## REGE

Watch out: this toolbox doesn't implement the REGE algorithm. It needs to be calculated from the UCINET VI software (available only for windows at https://sites.google.com/site/ucinetsoftware/home). The output of UCINET needs then to be transformed into a matlab matrix and saved in the folder data. Here I supposed that the maximum of REGE is 1000.
