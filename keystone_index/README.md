## What the program does  

This R program calculates the four different K indices - Kbu, Ktd, Kdir, Kindir. 

## Input format

It takes a textfile with the following structure:

plankton fish 1
fish	bird	1
bird bear 1

## How to interpret the output 

The result is recorded in a dataframe called resu. (So if you type resu and press enter, then it should give you the result.)

Resu has a format like this: nodeID, k, kbu, ktd, kdir, kindir.
