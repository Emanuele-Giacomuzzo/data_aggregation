Size of the clusters produced by the different clustering methods. (a) = hierarchical clustering with Jaccard index, (b) = hierarchical clustering with REGE index, (c) = maximisation of density-based modularity, (d) = maximisation of prey-based modularity, (e) = maximisation of predator-based modularity, (f) = group model.
