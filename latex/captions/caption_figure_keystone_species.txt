"Effect of aggregation on most the most important nodes in a food web. Red: central before and central after. Orange: central before and not central after. Purple: not central before and central after. Blue: not central before and not central after. The self-loops are not included in the figure for clarity. (a) = jaccard, (b) = rege, (c) = density-based modules, (d) = prey-based modules, (e) = predator-based modules, (f) = groups found by the group model. The food web of this figure is the one of the West Florida Shelf (Okey, 2004a)) and the largest network we used (55 nodes)."
