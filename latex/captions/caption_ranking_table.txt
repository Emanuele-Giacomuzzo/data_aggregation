"Table of the best Kendallâ€™s correlation coefficients. They are ranked from the clustering that produced the best correlation, to the clustering that produced the worst correlation.  Green = hierarchical clustering with Jaccard index, red = hierarchical clustering with REGE index, grey = density-based modules, yellow = prey-based modules, blue = predator-based modules, purple = groups produced by the group model. C1 = Best clustering, C2 = second best clustering, C3 = third best clustering, C4 = fourth best clustering, C5 = fifth best clustering."
