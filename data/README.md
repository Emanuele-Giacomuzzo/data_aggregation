These food webs are the same as the ones used by Heymans et al. (2014), but their enumeration has been changed. Also, to make it easier for me to work with these files, every single food webs of the 105 has its file. However, some of them are not available - i.e., their file is empty. This is because they are food webs I didn't use. Use the following to convert between our number and Heymans et al. (2014) number. You can find the food webs that Heymans et al. (2014) used in their supporting information. See the file enumeration_conversion.txt to see how to convert between the two enumerations.
