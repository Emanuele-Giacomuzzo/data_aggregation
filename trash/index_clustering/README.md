Hi Emanuele! Glad to know that! And sorry for the delay

I'm sending the code attached but I don't know if it will help you... it's really messy and not very efficient!
I haven't looked at it since then but maybe now I could do something better, (and thanks for your email cause I also have to review that paper ðŸ™ƒ)

I basically used GP Learn (https://gplearn.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ ) and adapted it to the problem.

I'm sorry, you'll probably need more explanations so feel free to shoot any questions any time. I believe we have a 6h difference, but if you want to schedule a call, not for this weekend but the next one, I'd be glad to try to help.

Good luck!

Hi Emanuele! 

Here is the data - no headers.
Each file contains 1000 rows referring to the 1000 studied networks.
The 'Â«INDEXÂ».txt' files contain the index-values in question and the have 15 columns (SP1-SP15) referring to all the 15 species, while the 'singleCRs.txt' contains the community response values in 12 columns referring only to the perturbed species (SP4-SP12). 
If something is not clear, let me know!

Thanks and sorry for the delay once again :) 
Catarina
