INTRODUCTION
    The importance of data aggregation
        - Data aggregation has already taken place during sampling
        - Data aggregation in wide networks
        - Wrong aggregation, wrong interpretation
        - Wrong assumptions, wrong sampling
    Similar species: similar connections
        - Trophospecies
        - Trophic role 
    Similar species: same module 
        - Density-based modularity
        - Predator-based and prey-based modularity 
        - Group model 
    Centrality indices as a proxy for food web structure
        - How different aggregations maintain the pattern
        - Maintaining network structure
        - Network used
METHODS
    Food web used
        - Description of the food web (image, connectance, average degree, degree distribution)
        - Delete node number 59
        - Delete self loops for certain measures. 
RESULTS
    Clustering
        - Number of clusters for each aggregation
        - Unique nodes (not clustered). Was it predicted by species uniqueness? 
    Wiring
        - Best link percentage
        - Best weight method
        - Change in main properties of the food web
    Centrality indices
        - The best ones
        - How to interpret the Spearman correlation coefficient (are the lower values also good ones?)
        - Are the rege clusters nested inside the Jaccard clusters? 
DISCUSSION
    Possible interpretation
        - Different uses of different clustering methods 
        - Density-based is not good for clustering
        - Pattern-based is surprisingly not good for clustering (considering only predator or prey might be a problem)
    Future directions
        - Using new similarity indices
        - Using new directed network clustering methods
        - Dynamical behaviour 
    Practical utility for keystone species
    

To add:
1. Group model 
2. We eliminated self-loops from trophic position
