\begin{enumerate}
  \item Compute the one-step matrix as in toplogical importance \item Compute the n-step matrix as in topological importance \item Compute the average effect matrix. The average effect matrix ($E(n)$) represents the effect of each node on the other nodes average by the number of steps

      \begin{equation}
        E_n=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}A_{\left(i\right)}
      \end{equation}

  \item Compute the interactor matrix.
      Compute the so-called interactor matrix ($M_T$), whose values tell us whether the interaction between two nodes is weak (W) or strong (S).
      To do this, we need to define a threshold over which a certain interaction is strong.
  \item Compute the topological overlap matrix.
      Compute a matrix with how many times two species interact strongly with the same predator, called the topological overlap matrix.
  \item Compute the trophic field overlap (TO)
      The trophic field overlap (TO) of a node is calculated by summing the elements of the rows of the topological overlap matrix.
\end{enumerate}
