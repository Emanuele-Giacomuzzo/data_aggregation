INTRODUCTION
Aggregation
  Time (Baird1989, Schwarz2020)
  Space (Warren1989)
Problems with sampling and missing data
  Sampling efforts and missing of data bias structure (Goldwasser1997)
  Especially in binary food webs (Thompson2000)
  Aggregation has effects on global metrics (Sugihara1989,Martinez1991,Martinez1992)

DISCUSSION
Centrality indices proxy for structure
  No studies about this
  Using them in other studies
  Choosing the most important indices/a singular index
  Different indices tells us different things
Future directions: new algorithms
  Other similarity indices
  Other types of modules
Future directions: effect of aggregation on indices
  On a combination of centrality indices
  On the most important centrality indices
  Across different interaction strength type, environmental gradients, food web properties
A good aggregation method
  It needs to maintain TP
  TP is important for the direction of where the perturbation propagates to (Curtsdotter2011)
  TP is important for risk of extinction (Binzer2011)
  TP is important for colonisation success (Holt2010)
Finding keystone species through aggregation
  Keystone species can be the ones that can't be aggregated (Bond1994)
  All aggregation methods show something different about a species (see the review of Cirtwill2018a)
  Which aggregation method for keystone species
  Non aggregable species across different aggregation methods
  Is aggregation better than centrality indices?
All these aggregation methods are legit
  Difference between group model and density-based
  Experiments checking whether different aggregation methods are the most important
  perturbation experiments for example
  different systems
Is it okay to aggregate?
  Better not to aggregate
  ADBM 83% link correctly predicted with body size classes vs 52% link predicted with species (Woodward2010b)
  Group into functional groups high redundancy to extinction vs no functional groups or species low redundancy to extinction (Petchey2002)
  Limits in what we can sample
  Limits in the data we can access
  Alternatives
Robustness of indices
  Fedor2009: DC, BC, CC, K, TI(1,10)
  No way of interpreting the index R for every index.
  "However, the patterns of robustness are quite complex and largely vary among the different food webs, because they can be heavily influenced by the topology of the network: and thus we suggest to use the robustness values in our study only as a guidance and recalculate the exact values for the networks to be analyzed whenever it is possible."
  I should have done a robustness analysis of centrality indices here.
  Only binary food webs.
Standards for food web construction
  Standards for sampling
  Standards for aggregation
Particularly important for certain taxa
