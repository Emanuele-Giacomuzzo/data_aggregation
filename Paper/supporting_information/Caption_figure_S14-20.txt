"Heat maps of the lower confidence interval of the mean kendall's rank correlation coefficients (Ï„). Each value in the heat map is the difference between kendall's rank correlation and its lower confidence interval. Figure 14: upper CI for all the clustering methods, figure15: upper CI for Jaccard index, figure16: upper Ci for REGE index, figure17: upper CI for density-based modules, figure 18: upper CI for prey-based modules, figure 19: upper CI for predator-based modules, figure20: upper CI for group model"
