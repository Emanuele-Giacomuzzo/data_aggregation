"Heat maps of the upper confidence interval of the mean kendall's rank correlation coefficients (Ï„). Each value in the heat map is the difference between kendall's rank correlation and its upper confidence interval. Figure 7: upper CI for all the clustering methods, figure8: upper CI for Jaccard index, figure9: upper Ci for REGE index, figure10: upper CI for density-based modules, figure 11: upper CI for prey-based modules, figure 12: upper CI for predator-based modules, figure13: upper CI for group model"
