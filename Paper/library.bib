abstract = {The outcomes of press perturbation experiments on community dynamics are difficult to predict because there is a high degree of indeterminacy in the strength and direction of ecological interactions. Ecologists need to quantify uncertainties in estimates of interaction strength, by determining all the possible values a given interaction strength could take and the relative likelihood of each value. In this study, we assess the degree to which fish effects on zooplankton and phytoplankton are indeterminate in direction using a combination of experimental data and Monte Carlo simulations. Based on probability distributions of interaction strength (i.e. effect magnitude), we estimated the probability of each fish interaction being negative, positive or undetermined in direction. We then investigated how interaction strength and its predictability might vary with experimental duration and the taxonomic resolution of food web data. Results show that most effects of fish on phyto- and zooplankton were indeed indeterminate, and that the effects of fish were more predictable in direction as the taxonomic resolution of food web data decreased and the experimental duration increased. Results also show that most distributions of interaction strength were not normal, suggesting that normal based statistical procedures for testing hypothesis about interaction strength may be misleading, as well as predictions of food web models assuming normal distributions of interaction strength. By considering the probability distributions and confidence intervals of interaction parameters, ecologists would better understand the outcomes of species interactions and make more realistic predictions about our perturbations in natural food webs.},

abstract = {High-throughput techniques are leading to an explosive growth in the size of biological databases and creating the opportunity to revolutionize our understanding of life and disease. Interpretation of these data remains, however, a major scientific challenge. Here, we propose a methodology that enables us to extract and display information contained in complex networks. Specifically, we demonstrate that we can find functional modules in complex networks, and classify nodes into universal roles according to their pattern of intra- and inter-module connections. The method thus yields a 'cartographic representation' of complex networks. Metabolic networks are among the most challenging biological networks and, arguably, the ones with most potential for immediate applicability. We use our method to analyse the metabolic networks of twelve organisms from three different superkingdoms. We find that, typically, 80{\%} of the nodes are only connected to other nodes within their respective modules, and that nodes with different roles are affected by different evolutionary constraints and pressures. Remarkably, we find that metabolites that participate in only a few reactions but that connect different modules are more conserved than hubs whose links are mostly within a single module.},

abstract = {Modelling strategies for predicting the potential impacts of climate change on the natural distribution of species have often focused on the characterization of a species' bioclimate envelope. A number of recent critiques have questioned the validity of this approach by pointing to the many factors other than climate that play an important part in determin- ing species distributions and the dynamics of distribution changes. Such factors include biotic interactions, evolu- tionary change and dispersal ability. This paper reviews and evaluates criticisms of bioclimate envelope models and dis- cusses the implications of these criticisms for the different modelling strategies employed. It is proposed that, although the complexity of the natural system presents fundamental limits to predictive modelling, the bioclimate envelope approach can provide a useful first approximation as to the potentially dramatic impact of climate change on biodiversity. However, it is stressed that the spatial scale at which these models are applied is of fundamental importance, and that model results should not be interpreted without due consider- ation of the limitations involved. A hierarchical modelling framework is proposed through which some of these limita- tions can be addressed within a broader, scale-dependent context. Key},

abstract = {1. Phylogenetic signal is the tendency of related species to resemble each other more than species drawn at randomfrom the same tree. This pattern is of considerable interest in a range of ecological and evolutionary research areas, and various indices have been proposed for quantifying it. Unfortunately, these indices often lead to contrasting results, and guidelines for choosing the most appropriate index are lacking. 2. Here, we compare the performance of four commonly used indices using simulated data. Data were generated with numerical simulations of trait evolution along phylogenetic trees under a variety of evolutionary models. We investigated the sensitivity of the approaches to the size of phylogenies, the resolution of tree structure and the availability of branch length information, examining both the response of the selected indices and the power of the associated statistical tests. 3. We found that under a Brownian motion (BM) model of trait evolution, Abouheif's Cmean and Pagel's $\lambda$ performed well and substantially better than Moran's I and Blomberg's K. Pagel's $\lambda$ provided a reliable effect size measure and performed better for discriminating between more complex models of trait evolution, but was computationally more demanding than Abouheif's Cmean. Blomberg's K was most suitable to capture the effects of changing evolutionary rates in simulation experiments. 4. Interestingly, sample size influenced not only the uncertainty but also the expected values of most indices, while polytomies and missing branch length information had only negligible impacts. 5. We propose guidelines for choosing among indices, depending on (a) their sensitivity to true underlying patterns of phylogenetic signal, (b) whether a test or a quantitative measure is required and (c) their sensitivities to different topologies of phylogenies. 6. These guidelines aimto better assess phylogenetic signal and distinguish it fromrandom trait distributions. They were developed under the assumption of BM, and additional simulations with more complex trait evolution models show that they are to a certain degree generalizable. They are particularly useful in comparative analyses, when requiring a proxy for niche similarity, and in conservation studies that explore phylogenetic loss associated with extinction risks of specific clades. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

abstract = {Aim Indicators for biodiversity are needed to facilitate the identification of com- plementary reserve networks for biodiversity conservation. One widely adopted approach is to use indicator taxa, i.e. a single taxon such as birds or butterflies, despite the ongoing debate regarding their usefulness as indicators of broader biodiversity. Here we assess several aspects, such as influence of species number, of indicator taxa for three extensive data sets to improve our insight into the effective- ness of indicator taxa. Location Denmark, sub-Saharan Africa and Uganda. Methods First, we investigate to what extent variation in species number between indicator taxa (e.g. 488 mammal spp. vs. 210 snake spp.) is causing the differences in effectiveness between indicator taxa. Second, we investigate whether indicator taxa are capable of outperforming indicator groups composed of random sets of species chosen among all taxa. Finally, we assess the correlation of specific properties such as mean range size of the indicator taxa to their effectiveness. We investigate these aspects of the effectiveness of indicator taxa through the separate analysis of three distinct distributional species data sets: sub-Saharan Africa (4,039 spp.), Denmark (847 spp.) and Uganda (2,822 spp.). Results We overall found that indicator taxa comprising a greater number of species tend to perform better than indicator taxa with fewer species (e.g. 488 mammal spp. outperform 210 snake spp.), although there are some exceptions. Second, we found most indicator taxa to perform worse than indicator groups consisting of a comparable number of species selected among all taxa. Finally, the effectiveness of indicator taxa was seen to correlate poorly with selected distributional properties such as mean range size of the indicator taxa, suggesting that it is difficult to predict which taxa are efficient biodiversity indicators. Main conclusions Overall, these findings might suggest that focus should simply be on increasing the number of species among all taxa as basis for priority setting, rather than striving to obtain the ‘perfect' indicator taxa.

abstract = {—We investigated the Ria Formosa Natural Park located in the lagoon of the same name; it is famous for a great diversity of bird species and offers outstanding possibilities for the development of a special type of ecological tourism, birdwatching, that attracts birdwatchers from across the globe. It is shown that the existing natural resources on this territory should be complemented by an appropriate infrastructure and the rules in order to ensure tourism sustainability and development in connection with a high ecological significance of the territory and a heavy demand from visitors. Using landscape approach and methods of geoinformation-based landscape-interpretation mapping, extrapolating the density of different bird species, calculating integral indicators for assessing ornithological resources as well as infrastructure development techniques, we undertook a planning procedure of the birdwatching tourism infrastructure, including trails and observation points. As initial data, we used vegetation and soil maps, topographic maps, space images, data on the density of bird species in different biotopes, and field investigations. We generated the population density maps for each bird species as well as the biotope assessment map for all bird species, based on calculating the sum of the products of densities of each species by the ecological value of the species. Also, the landscape map was used to develop the territorial zoning map, having regard to the possibilities and limitations of constructing trails of different classes. Using spatial cross-matching of the assessment maps for ornithological resources and the trail zoning map, we identified places holding promise for the construction of the birdwatching tourism infrastructure. It is shown that the suggested method provides a means of making a proximate assessment of the territory from different perspectives, based on knowledge of a territory's landscape structure; it is a prompt and inexpensive technique as contrasted to field investigations of the entire territory; however, it calls for further detailed investigation into promising areas.},

abstract = {One important aspect of climate change is the increase in average temperature, which will not only have direct physiological effects on all species but also indirectly modifies abundances, interaction strengths, food-web topologies, community stability and functioning. In this theme issue, we highlight a novel pathway through which warming indirectly affects ecological communities: by changing their size structure (i.e. the body-size distributions). Warming can shift these distributions towards dominance of small- over large-bodied species. The conceptual, theoretical and empirical research described in this issue, in sum, suggests that effects of temperature may be dominated by changes in size structure, with relatively weak direct effects. For example, temperature effects via size structure have implications for top-down and bottom-up control in ecosystems and may ultimately yield novel communities. Moreover, scaling up effects of temperature and body size from physiology to the levels of populations, communities and ecosystems may provide a crucially important mechanistic approach for forecasting future consequences of global warming. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Royal Society.},

Using field experiments, we investigated both ecological and evolutionary responses of pea aphids ( Acyrthosiphon pisum), a common agricultural pest, to increased frequency of episodic heat shocks. One predator species ameliorated the decrease in aphid population growth with increasing heat shocks, whereas a second predator did not, with this contrast caused by behavioral differences between predators. We also compared aphid strains with stably inherited differences in heat tolerance caused by bacterial endosymbionts and showed the potential for rapid evolution for heat-shock tolerance.

abstract = {Climate change, land-use change and introductions of non-native species are key determinants of biodiversity change worldwide. However, the extent to which anthropogenic drivers of environmental change interact to affect biological communities is largely unknown, especially over longer time periods. Here, we show that plant community composition in 996 Swedish landscapes has consistently shifted to reflect the warmer and wetter climate that the region has experienced during the second half of the 20th century. Using community climatic indices, which reflect the average climatic associations of the species within each landscape at each time period, we found that species compositions in 74{\%} of landscapes now have a higher representation of warm-associated species than they did previously, while 84{\%} of landscapes now host more species associated with higher levels of precipitation. In addition to a warmer and wetter climate, there have also been large shifts in land use across the region, while the fraction of non-native species has increased in the majority of landscapes. Climatic warming at the landscape level appeared to favour the colonization of warm-associated species, while also potentially driving losses in cool-associated species. However, the resulting increases in community thermal means were apparently buffered by landscape simplification (reduction in habitat heterogeneity within landscapes) in the form of increased forest cover. Increases in non-native species, which generally originate from warmer climates than Sweden, were a strong driver of community-level warming. In terms of precipitation, both landscape simplification and increases in non-natives appeared to favour species associated with drier climatic conditions, to some extent counteracting the climate-driven shift towards wetter communities. Anthropogenic drivers can act both synergistically and antagonistically to determine trajectories of change in biological communities over time. Therefore, it is important to consider multiple drivers of global change when trying to understand, manage and predict biodiversity in the future.},

abstract = {Seagrass declines have been reported worldwide, mostly as a consequence of anthropogenic disturbance. In Ria Formosa lagoon, southern Portugal, the intertidal meadows of Zostera noltii are highly disturbed by clam harvesters. The most common technique used to collect the clams consists of digging and tilling the sediment with a modified knife with a large blade. Here we present both descriptive and experimental evidence of the negative effects of clam harvest on the Z. noltii populations of Ria Formosa. A comparison between disturbed and undisturbed meadows suggests that clam harvesting activities change the species population structure by significantly reducing shoot density and total biomass, particularly during August, when the harvest effort is higher. Experimental harvest revealed a short-term impact on shoot density, which rapidly recovered to control levels during the following month. An experimental manipulation of rhizome fragmentation revealed that plant survival is reduced only when fragmented rhizomes are left with 1 intact internode. Shoot production and rhizome elongation and production of fragmented rhizomes having 2 to 5 internodes were not significantly affected, even though growth and production were lower when only 2 internodes were left. Experimental shoot damage at different positions along the rhizome had a significant effect on plant survival, rhizome elongation, and production only when the apical shoot was removed. Our results show that clam harvest can adversely affect Z. noltii meadows of Ria Formosa while revealing a low modular integration that allows the species to rapidly recover from physical damage.},

abstract = {Diversity metrics are commonly used to measure or quantify species-level biodiversity in a given area. In recent decades, ecologists developed many measures and indices in order to quantify a larger proportion of information about communities or species assemblages. Commonly these measures are based on species richness or species evenness, in relation to their relative abundance. Among the most common diversity metrics are the indices of taxonomic diversity, functional diversity and phylogenetic diversity. These metrics are often used to assess effectiveness of conservation planning. One concern on the use of many diversity metrics, especially in modeling, is the potential redundancy among these indices and measures. Many scientists explored the associations among different diversity metrics, finding clear patterns. For instance, functional richness and the functional diversity (FD) index are both positively correlated with species richness, while functional evenness should be unrelated to species richness. Furthermore, explorations focusing on associations between phylogenetic diversity and taxonomic or functional diversity metrics are few. However, despite the importance of the types of environment has on biotic assemblage rules, there are no studies comparing the association among diversity metrics across different type of environments. Here, we found higher values of taxonomic diversity, functional richness and Rao's quadratic entropy (RaoQ) in farmland than in forests and grasslands. Forest bird communities were characterized by a large amount of evolutionary history as reflected by community evolutionary distinctiveness (CED). Furthermore, associations among diversity and community metrics in bird communities differ across types of environments. Within functional diversity metrics, associations between functional richness and RaoQ as well as associations between functional evenness and divergence were always positive, independently of the type of environment. The associations between functional richness and evenness or divergence, as well as functional evenness and RaoQ, changed strength and direction of correlation between different types of environment. In conclusion, a) large scale conservation planning strategies have to consider that different environments support different dimensions of bird diversity, and b) when modeling many diversity metrics, associations among diversity and community metrics can also change across environments.},

The three common procedures in assessing whether a random sample of independent observations of size n come from a population with a normal distribution are: graphical methods (histograms, boxplots, Q-Q-plots), numerical methods (skewness and kurtosis indices) and formal normality tests. This paper* compares the power of four formal tests of normality: Shapiro-Wilk (SW) test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, Lilliefors (LF) test and Anderson-Darling (AD) test. Power comparisons of these four tests were obtained via Monte Carlo simulation of sample data generated from alternative distributions that follow symmetric and asymmetric distributions. Ten thousand samples of various sample size were generated from each of the given alternative symmetric and asymmetric distributions. The power of each test was then obtained by comparing the test of normality statistics with the respective critical values. Results show that Shapiro-Wilk test is the most powerful normality test, followed by Anderson-Darling test, Lilliefors test and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. However, the power of all four tests is still low for small sample size.},

abstract = {Global climate change is predicted to have major negative impacts on biodiversity, particularly if important habitat-modifying species undergo range shifts. The sea urchin Centrostephanus rodgersii (Diadematidae) has recently undergone poleward range expansion to relatively cool, macroalgal dominated rocky reefs of eastern Tasmania (southeast Australia). As in its historic environment, C. rodgersii in the extended range is now found in association with a simplified 'barrens' habitat grazed free of macroalgae. The new and important role of this habitat-modifier on reef structure and associated biodiversity was clearly demonstrated by completely removing C. rodgersii from incipient barrens patches at an eastern Tasmanian site and monitoring the macroalgal response relative to unmanipulated barrens patches. In barrens patches from which C. rodgersii was removed, there was a rapid proliferation of canopy-forming macroalgae (Ecklonia radiata and Phyllospora comosa), and within 24 months the algal community structure had converged with that of adjacent macroalgal beds where C. rodgersii grazing was absent. A notable scarcity of limpets on C. rodgersii barrens in eastern Tasmania (relative to the historic range) likely promotes rapid macroalgal recovery upon removal of the sea urchin. In the recovered macroalgal habitat, faunal composition redeveloped similar to that from adjacent intact macroalgal beds in terms of total numbers of taxa, total individuals and Shannon diversity. In contrast, the faunal community of the barrens habitat is overwhelmingly impoverished. Of 296 individual floral/faunal taxa recorded, only 72 were present within incipient barrens, 253 were present in the recovered patches, and 221 were present within intact macroalgal beds. Grazing activity of C. rodgersii results in an estimated minimum net loss of approximately 150 taxa typically associated with Tasmanian macroalgal beds in this region. Such a disproportionate effect by a single range-expanding species demonstrates that climate change may lead to unexpectedly large impacts on marine biodiversity as key habitat-modifying species undergo range modification. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

DG in particular is seeing the fastest growth among renewable energy projects, and is directly related to the incentives. Hawaii has the highest electricity costs in the country due to the high percentage of oil burning steam generation, and therefore has some of the highest penetration of distributed PV in the nation. The High Penetration PV project on Oahu aims to understand the effects of high penetration PV on the distribution level, to identify penetration levels creating disturbances on the circuit, and to offer mitigating solutions based on model results. Power flow models are validated using data collected from solar resources and load monitors deployed throughout the circuit. Existing interconnection methods and standards are evaluated in these emerging high penetration scenarios. A key finding is a shift in the level of detail to be considered and moving away from steady-state peak time analysis towards dynamic and time varying simulations. Each level of normal interconnection study is evaluated and enhanced to a new level of detail, allowing full understanding of each issue.},

abstract = {Climate change drivers affect plant community productivity via three pathways: (i) direct effects of drivers on plants; (ii) the response of species abundances to drivers (community response); and (iii) the feedback effect of community change on productivity (community effect). The contribution of each pathway to driver-productivity relationships depends on functional traits of dominant species. We used data from three experiments in Texas, USA, to assess the role of community dynamics in the aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) response of C4 grasslands to two climate drivers applied singly: atmospheric CO2 enrichment and augmented summer precipitation. The ANPPdriver response differed among experiments because community responses and effects differed. ANPP increased by 80-120 g m -2 per 100 $\mu$l l-1 rise in CO2 in separate experiments with pasture and tallgrass prairie assemblages. Augmenting ambient precipitation by 128 mm during one summer month each year increased ANPP more in native than in exotic communities in a third experiment. The community effect accounted for 21-38{\%} of the ANPP CO2 response in the prairie experiment but little of the response in the pasture experiment. The community response to CO2 was linked to species traits associated with greater soil water from reduced transpiration (e.g. greater height). Community effects on the ANPP CO2 response and the greater ANPP response of native than exotic communities to augmented precipitation depended on species differences in transpiration efficiency. These results indicate that feedbacks from community change influenced ANPP-driver responses. However, the species traits that regulated community effects on ANPP differed from the traits that determined how communities responded to drivers. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author.},

abstract = {The sustained decline in habitat quality and community integrity highlights the importance of understanding how communities and environmental variation interactively contribute to ecosystem services. We performed a laboratory experiment manipulating effects of acclimation temperature (5, 15, 25, and 35°C) on resource acquisition, assimilation and subsequent ecosystem services provided by eight freshwater mussel species. Our results suggest that although freshwater mussels are broadly categorized as filter feeders, there are distinct nested functional guilds (thermally tolerant and sensitive) associated with their thermal performance. At 35°C, thermally tolerant species have increased resource assimilation and higher rates of contributed ecosystem services (nutrient excretion, benthic-pelagic coupling). Conversely, thermally sensitive species have decreased assimilation rates and display an array of functional responses including increased/decreased benthic-pelagic coupling and nutrient excretion. Although thermally sensitive species may be in poorer physiological condition at warmer temperatures, their physiological responses can have positive effects on ecosystem services. We extrapolated these results to real mussel beds varying in species composition to address how shifts in community composition coupled with climate change may shift their contributed ecological services. Comparative field data indicate that two co-existing, abundant species with opposing thermal performance (Actinonaias ligamentina, Amblema plicata) differentially dominate community biomass. Additionally, communities varying in the relative proportion of these species differentially influence the magnitude (benthic-pelagic coupling) and quality (N:P excretion) of ecosystem services. As species are increasingly threatened by climate change, greater emphasis should be placed on understanding the contribution of physiological stress to the integrity and functioning of ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Pelage color and pattern, facial markings, cranial morphology, and vocalization have been studied comparatively in the Presbytis melalophos group in Sumatera. Pelage coloration of fetuses and neonates were described for P. melalophos and P. femoralis. Based on this study, three species-P thomasi, R melalophos, and P. femoralis-are recognized. Using field data that have been gathered since 1981, the distribution of these three species has been mapped. The resultant map reveals that no sympatry is known and that rivers form the interspecific boundaries. However, rivers apparently are not barriers to the dispersal of species in this group. Instead, distributions appear to be limited ecologically, by competitive exclusion. Historically, it appears that the ancestral stock initially dispersed throughout this area, then the P. melalophos stock split from the P thomasi-P. femoralis stock, the P. thomasi stock split from the P. femoralis stock, and, finally, the P. femoralis stock dispersed to eastern Sumatera. It appears unlikely that the centrifugal speciation hypothesis based on the principle of metachromism applies to deployment of the P. melalophos group.},

Here, we distinguish these concepts, discuss their operationalization, and identify the objectives that each is suited to. Resilience is useful when ecosystems risk losing the ability to recover and requires system modelling. Vulnerability can either be quantitative, measuring the ability of a system to remain above a critical threshold, or qualitative and used to evaluate the exposure of a system to disturbance and attributes that confer adaptive capacity and sensitivity to disturbance. As such, vulnerability is well-suited to assessments of coupled social-ecological systems. Robustness measures the ability of a system to maintain itself within a narrow range of function and is ideally suited to problems that require careful setting of upper and lower bounds for system properties, such as optimal fisheries yield. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We research scientists often worry about the future of our careers. Is our research an exciting path or a dead end that will end our careers prematurely? Predicting scientific trajectories is a daily task for hiring committees, funding agencies and department heads who probe CVs searching for signs of scientific potential. One popular measure of success is physicist Jorge Hirsch's h-index 1 , which captures the quality (citations) and quantity (number) of papers, thus representing scientific achievements better than either factor alone. A scientist has an h-index of n if he or she has published n articles receiving at least n citations each 2 . Einstein, Darwin and Feynman, for example, have impressive h-indices of 96, 63 and 53, respectively. According to Hirsch, an h-index of 12 for a physicist — meaning 12 papers with at least 12 citations each — could qualify him or her for tenure at a major university. However, the h-index 3 and similar metrics 4 can capture only past accomplishments, not future achievements 5 . Here we attempt to predict the future h-index of scientists on the basis of features found in most CVs. We maintain that the best way of predicting a scientist's future success is for peers to evaluate scientific contributions and research depth, but think that our methods could be valuable complementary tools. The typical research CV contains information on the number of publications, those in high-profile journals, the h-index and collaborators. One can also infer interdisciplinary breadth, the length and quality of training, the amount of funding received and even the standing of the scientist's PhD adviser. Such factors are taken into account for hiring decisions, but how should they be weighted? Fortunately, obtaining data on the scientific activities of individual researchers has never been easier. Using all of these features, we can begin to probe the scientific enterprise statistically.},

abstract = {The feeding ecology of the Phayre's leaf monkey Presbytis phayrei was studied in a secondary forest in the Gumti Wildlife Sanctuary (Tripura State, India) to assess the impact of shifting cultivation on the long-term survival of the species. Data were collected on the time spent feeding by one group on various plant species, and also on the vegetation, phenology and regeneration in plots subjected to shifting cultivation. Data for eight months indicated that Phayre's leaf monkey fed primarily on young leaves and to a lesser extent on shoots and seeds. Young leaves formed a consistently high proportion of the diet in all months. Most of the 18 food plant species were exploited for young leaves, but only a few for other plant parts. Six species accounted for more than 65{\%} of the diet in all eight months, and more than 75{\%} over all months. Regeneration and accumulation of woody biomass in areas subjected to shifting cultivation were rapid as a result of germination and coppicing. Five of the six most used plant species dominated this regeneration. It is concluded that Phayre's leaf monkey will survive in secondary forests provided regeneration is allowed to continue for at least 9–10 years. The progressively shortening cycle for shifting cultivation, however, poses a threat, and the small patches of primary forest which remain are also disappearing due to shifting cultivation or degradation. Their role as seed banks will decrease, leading to further impoverishment of the secondary forests.},

Formal presentation of the feeding links between species has often been in the form of a food web graph and these images have led some to draw an analogy between food webs and road maps. The chapter presents a brief review of patterns catalogued to date. Published food webs combine two sets of information about the community of animals and plants they represent: a list of the elements in the system, and the distribution of feeding link (information on who eats whom). The chapter also discusses food web models and concentrates on the underlying principles of these modeling approaches; Lotka-Volterra: an industry standard, model predictions and the effects of data re-evaluation, community assembly, and the cascade model. {\textcopyright} 1993 Academic Press Limited},

abstract = {The loss of a species from an ecological community can set up a cascade of secondary extinctions that in the worst case could lead to the collapse of the community. Both deterministic and stochastic mechanisms may be involved in such secondary extinctions. To investigate the extent of secondary extinctions in ecological communities following the loss of a species, we here develop a community viability analysis. We introduce a measure called the "quasi-collapse risk" that is defined as the probability that the number of species in a community falls below some defined value within a fixed period of time following the loss of a species. We develop deterministic and stochastic methods for finding post-extinction communities. We use these methods to investigate the relationship between diversity (species richness) and quasi-collapse risks in model communities. It is shown that, in a deterministic context, communities with more species within trophic levels have a larger fraction of species remaining in post-extinction communities. This benefit of species richness is to a large extent lost in the presence of demographic stochasticity. The reason for this is a negative relationship between population density and species diversity. We also show that communities become increasingly triangular in shape as secondary extinctions take place, due to greater extinction risk of species at higher trophic levels. We argue that this new approach holds some promise for identifying fragile ecosystems and keystone species.},

abstract = {Understanding ecological interaction strengths is one of the main objectives of ecology. Recently, two methods for estimating interaction strengths of predator- prey interactions in nature have been proposed: a field observation approach proposed by Novak and Wootton (2008) and stable isotope analysis. The field observation method estimates feeding rates based on feeding observations, handling times and prey abundances. Stable isotope analysis estimates diet proportions using mixing models of ratios of heavy to light carbon and nitrogen isotopes in body tissues of predators and their prey. However, because these two methods are relatively new, few studies have been conducted to understand and contrast their estimates of interaction strengths. I sought to quantify the correlation between the estimates of interaction strength made by the two methods. Both methods were conducted simultaneously in a rocky intertidal community on the Oregon coast with the whelk Nucella ostrina as the focal predator and the barnacle Balanus glandula and the mussel Mytilus trossulus as the two primary prey species. I documented a non-significant and weak correlation between the two method's estimates of interaction strength. I hypothesize that this lack of correspondence between the methods may be explained by abnormal $\delta$13C enrichment in the whelks compared to their prey, and a lack of variation in observed predator diets between replicate sample populations.

Species have to overcome several filters to become a pest (transport, establishment, spread and impact). Few studies have checked the traits that confer ability to overcome these steps in the same species. The aim of the present study is to review the available information on the life-history and ecological traits of the mud snail, Potamopyrgus antipodarum Gray (Hydrobiidae, Mollusca), native from New Zealand, in order to explain its invasive success at different aquatic ecosystems around the world. A wide tolerance range to physico-chemical factors has been found to be a key trait for successful transport. A high competitive ability at early stages of succession can explains its establishment success in human-altered ecosystems. A high reproduction rate, high capacity for active and passive dispersal, and the escape from native predators and parasites explains its spread success. The high reproduction and the ability to monopolize invertebrate secondary production explain its high impact in the invaded ecosystems. However, further research is needed to understand how other factors, such as population density or the degree of human perturbation can modify the invasive success of this aquatic snail. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

We focus on various aspects of food-web structural integrity including robustness, community collapse and threshold periods, and how these features relate to assumptions underlying different models, different species loss sequences and simple measures of diversity and complexity. Hierarchical feeding, a fundamental characteristic of food-web structure, appears to impose a cost in terms of robustness and other aspects of structural integrity. However, exponential-type link distributions, also characteristic of more realistic models, generally confer greater structural robustness than the less skewed link distributions of less realistic models. In most cases for the more realistic models, increased robustness and decreased levels of web collapse are associated with increased diversity, measured as species richness S., and increased complexity, measured as connectance C. These and other results, including a surprising sensitivity of more realistic model food webs to loss of species with few links to other species, are compared with prior work based on empirical food-web data. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Individual-Based Modeling in Conservation Biology A major challenge for food-web research is studying diversity and variability more explicitly. This means a focus on individual-level variability in populations (Bolnick et al., 2011) that hopefully might help to better understand how structural properties predict dynamical behavior (Dunne, 2006). One reason why linking structure to dynamics is still a hard challenge can be that intrapopulation variability is relatively poorly considered in most models. Yet defining developmental stages as graph nodes is a step toward managing this challenge: for example, in many food-web models certain species are represented by separate graph nodes that include juveniles and adults. Trophic status and network dynamics can be quite sensitive to this kind of demographic aggregation (or resolution) of the web and are expected to be influenced by individual-level differences in terms of behavior and feeding habits. Individual-level variability includes genetic, demographic, and stochastic factors and to date it is not easy to incorporate all these in most modeling frameworks. Yet developing the methodological background of individual-based modeling seems to be very useful for future research and applications. Since individual-level differences are more important in smaller populations (Lande, 1988), studying their effects explicitly is relevant for conservation efforts. Using network metrics as proxies or predictors of food-web dynamics is an old but still open issue. For an example, network hubs are supposed to be species of key importance and hubbish networks are thought to be safe against errors but vulnerable against attacks (Montoya and Sol{\'{e}}, 2002). We make structural predictions routinely but we are very poor in testing these on either real-time series or simulation models. One way to make our knowledge more robust here is by adopting a comparative approach: studying spatio-temporal food-web gradients can inform about possible relationships between the position occupied by species in trophic networks and their dynamics. Based on spatio-temporal data reporting on various ecological gradients (e.g., plankton biomass: Siokou-Frangou et al., 2002), different versions of food webs can be constructed to represent changes in space and time (Warren, 1989; Ulanowicz, 1996; Winemiller, 1996; Bondavalli et al., 2006), and ecosystem management and restoration can be based on this kind of comparative knowledge (Tallberg et al., 1999). Food-web studies are being improved by the recent development of constructing series of food webs describing a community along an environmental gradient (Lafferty and Dunne, 2010).},

The recent increase in the number of off-leash dog parks across the country is evidence of these demands of dog owners. Evaluation of four dog parks in Texas and Florida was conducted to investigate use patterns of dog parks and user activities, to identify user satisfaction and perception, and to provide insights in developing effective dog parks. The results indicated that dog parks received considerable use and served a variety of groups and users were generally satisfied with dog parks. Dog parks were identified as the most frequented locations regarding the provision of outdoor exercise and socialization for their dogs and proximity to a dog park was positively related to frequency of use and satisfaction. A substantial number of respondents perceived the benefits of a dog park for the dogs' physical well-being and for building a sense of community by providing the opportunity to socialize with neighbors. These research findings and design guidelines will help expand the knowledge base regarding parks and guide the future planning, design, and evaluation of dog parks. {\textcopyright}2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {1. Aquatic herbivores typically have much higher concentrations of nutrients (e.g. N and P) in their tissues than there is in the food they eat. These stoichiometric differences can cause herbivores to be limited by the elemental quality of their food, which could affect, in turn, the structure of consumer communities and even alter key ecosystem processes. 2. In streams and in the littoral zone of shallow lakes, periphyton is an important food resource for benthic animals. Studying the elemental composition of periphyton may help us to understand food-web structure, and any reciprocal effect of this structure on periphyton stoichiometry. 3. To understand how alterations in the food-web structure affect the elemental composition of periphyton in a eutrophic lake, we carried out a long-term experiment (14 months) in large-scale mesocosms (40 m3), in which we manipulated food-web structure, and which were dominated either by planktivorous fish (Rutilus rutilus) or herbivorous invertebrates (without fish). Periphyton was sampled monthly at three depths (0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 m) to determine its biomass and elemental composition (C/N/P ratio). Food-web structure, physical and chemical parameters were monitored throughout the experiment. 4. Fish had indirect positive effect on periphyton biomass, leading to twofold higher levels than in herbivore-dominated mesocosms. This result was probably due to control of benthic consumers by fish, suggesting a strong top-down control on periphyton by their consumers in fishless enclosures. 5. The elemental ratios C/P and C/N were lower in deep water in both treatments, mainly mediated by light availability, in accordance with the light/nutrient ratio hypothesis. These ratios were also lower in fishless treatments, probably due to increases in inorganic nutrient availability and grazing pressure in herbivore-dominated systems. During winter, periphyton elemental composition was similar in both treatments, and was unrelated to inorganic nutrient availability. 6. These results indicate that any alteration of food-web structure in lakes, such as in biomanipulation experiments, is likely to modify both the biomass and elemental quality of periphyton. Resultant effects on the consumers of periphyton and macrophytes could play a key role in the success of biomanipulations and should be taken into account in further studies. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

abstract = {Nectarivorous birds and bird-pollinated plants are linked by a network of interactions. Here I ask how these interactions influence evolution and community composition. I find near complete evidence for the effect of birds on plant evolution. Experiments show the process in action—birds select among floral phenotypes in a population—and comparative studies find the resulting pattern—bird-pollinated species have long-tubed, red flowers with large nectar volumes. Speciation is accomplished in one “magical” step when adaptation for bird pollination brings about divergent morphology and reproductive isolation. In contrast, evidence that plants drive bird evolution is fragmentary. Studies of selection on population-level variation are lacking, but the resulting pattern is clear—nectarivorous birds have evolved a remarkable number of times and often have long bills and brush-tipped or tubular tongues. At the level of the ecological guild, birds select among plant species via an effect on seed set and thus determine plant community composition. Plants simultaneously influence the relative fitness of bird species and thus determine the composition of the bird guild. Interaction partners may give one guild member a constant fitness advantage, resulting in competitive exclusion and community change, or may act as limiting resources that depress the fitness of frequent species, thus stabilizing community composition and allowing the coexistence of diversity within bird and plant guilds.Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics, Volume 50 is November 4, 2019.

The analysis of the nominal and verbal dative constructions has been carried out on the basis of the lexicon-grammar classification of Italian verbs, focusing on the various constructions produced by the application of transformations. Furthermore, particular attention has been given to the ambiguity of some dative nominal sequences. I have proposed a hypothesis that accounts for the fact that these structures, though in principle ambiguous, usually have a preferential reading, due to the adjacency of the complements. This hypothesis has been verified by applying the electronic dictionaries and grammars to an Italian corpus and the results drawn up with the automatic corpus analysis show that the most frequent dative constructions are those involving only the object. Finally, the results of this research have been compared to those drawn up by T. De Mauro (1965) in his study on the dative in classical Greek. Both results not only confirm the linguistic intuition on the preferred vs. the non-preferred interpretation, but also show the discrepancy between the theoretical dative constructions and the real usage.},

abstract = {Introduction Food webs are complex networks of trophic interactions (Cohen, 1978). Identification of the factors underlying the architecture of these networks remains a key question in ecology, in the hope that this will reveal how communities may be conserved in the face of species loss and climate change. Until now, this question has mainly been tackled with two different approaches: “a priori” (Ross, 1911), through stochastic or evolutionary models aimed at reproducing the essence of the system (Cohen and Newman, 1985; Williams and Martinez, 2000; Drossel et al., 2001; Cattin et al., 2004; Stouffer et al., 2005; Rossberg et al., 2006; Allesina et al., 2008; Capit{\'{a}}n et al., 2013), and “a posteriori,” through mechanistic or statistical models aimed at inferring observed networks (Petchey et al., 2008; Allesina and Pascual, 2009; Rohr et al., 2010, 2016). In the first approach, assumptions about the principles underlying food-web structure are used to construct models. Following the assumptions, model food webs are generated and compared with observed data. In almost all of these models, the input parameters are the numbers of species and the numbers of trophic links. For each species, some “abstract traits” are generated randomly (“ranks” for the cascade model, “niche values” for the niche model, etc.). The comparison with observed food webs is typically achieved indirectly, by generating a large number of networks and comparing them with observed webs through statistical descriptors, e.g., the proportion of top species, or the average chain length (Cohen et al., 1990; Williams and Martinez, 2008). A limitation of this approach is that different models can yield very similar results, a well-known problem with a-priori models (e.g., Cohen, 1968). In the second approach, observed food webs are fitted using models with the objective of identifying the underlying structure. In food-web ecology, this approach is based on mechanistic (Petchey et al., 2008), or statistical (also called probabilistic) models that use biological traits (usually body size) as explanatory variables or latent traits (Rohr et al., 2010; Williams et al., 2010; Williams and Purves, 2011; Rohr et al., 2016). Direct comparison of the inferred and observed food webs is possible, e.g., by using the percentage of correctly fitted trophic links.},

abstract = {1. We tested the hypothesis that indirect food web interactions between some common, invertivorous fishes and their prey would positively affect growth of an algivorous fish species. Specifically, we predicted that orangethroat darter (Etheostoma spectabile) would increase periphyton biomass via a top-down pathway, indirectly enhancing growth of the algivorous central stoneroller minnow (Campostoma anomalum). Moreover, we predicted that sand shiner (Notropis stramineus) would increase periphyton biomass via a bottom-up pathway and indirectly enhance growth of the stoneroller minnow. 2. In an 83-day experiment in large, outdoor, stream mesocosms, we stocked two fish species per mesocosm (stoneroller and either darter or shiner), estimated the effects of the invertivorous and grazing fishes on periphyton biomass and estimated growth of the algivorous fish. 3. The darter consumed grazing invertebrates, indirectly increasing periphyton biomass. The shiner consumed terrestrial insects as predicted, but it did not affect periphyton biomass. 4. In support of our hypothesis, the darter indirectly enhanced stoneroller growth. As predicted, stonerollers consumed the increased periphyton in streams with darters, resulting in greater growth, condition and gut fullness compared to streams without darters. No indirect interaction was observed between stonerollers and shiners. 5. Our study suggests that some invertivorous fish species can positively affect growth of algivorous fishes through indirect food web interactions. Thus, in stream communities, it is possible that the loss of a single, invertivorous fish taxon could have negative consequences on algivorous fish populations via the removal of positive indirect food web interactions. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Authors.},

abstract = {Trophic interactions are central to ecosystem functioning, but the link between food web structure and ecosystem functioning remains obscure. Regularities (i.e. consistent patterns) in food web structure suggest the possibility of regularities in ecosystem functioning, which might be used to relate structure to function. We introduce a novel, genetic algorithm approach to simulate food webs with maximized throughput (a proxy for ecosystem functioning) and compare the structure of these simulated food webs to real empirical food webs using common metrics of food web structure. We repeat this analysis using robustness to secondary extinctions (a proxy for ecosystem resilience) instead of throughput to determine the relative contributions of ecosystem functioning and ecosystem resilience to food web structure. Simulated food webs that maximized robustness were similar to real food webs when connectance (i.e. levels of interaction across the food web) was high, but this result did not extend to food webs with low connectance. Simulated food webs that maximized throughput or a combination of throughput and robustness were not similar to any real food webs. Simulated maximum‐throughput food webs differed markedly from maximum‐robustness food webs, which suggests that maximizing different ecological functions can generate distinct food web structures. Based on our results, food web structure would appear to have a stronger relationship with ecosystem resilience than with ecosystem throughput. Our genetic algorithm approach is general and is well suited to large, realistically complex food webs. Genetic algorithms can incorporate constraints on structure and can generate outputs that can be compared directly to empirical data. Our method can be used to explore a range of maximization or minimization hypotheses, providing new perspectives on the links between structure and function in ecological systems. The authors introduce a method to link the structure and function of food webs and demonstrate that the maximization of different functions predicts distinct food web structures. The approach is general and could be applied to a range of biological systems, including food webs, mutualistic networks, gene‐regulatory networks and animal social networks.},

abstract = {Biological Diversity provides an up-to-date, authoritative review of the methods of measuring and assessing biological diversity, together with their application. The book's emphasis is on quantifying the variety, abundance, and occurrence of taxa, and on providing objective and clear guidance for both scientists and managers. This is a fast-moving field and one that is the focus of intense research interest. However the rapid development of new methods, the inconsistent and sometimes confusing application of old ones, and the lack of consensus in the literature about the best approach, means that there is a real need for a current synthesis. Biological Diversity covers fundamental measurement issues such as sampling, re-examines familiar diversity metrics (including species richness, diversity statistics, and estimates of spatial and temporal turnover), discusses species abundance distributions and how best to fit them, explores species occurrence and the spatial structure of biodiversity, and investigates alternative approaches used to assess trait, phylogenetic, and genetic diversity. The final section of the book turns to a selection of contemporary challenges such as measuring microbial diversity, evaluating the impact of disturbance, assessing biodiversity in managed landscapes, measuring diversity in the imperfect fossil record, and using species density estimates in management and conservation.},

abstract = {We investigated the predatory effects of Dytiscus alaskanus, a large predaceous diving beetle, on the biomass, species composition and diversity of fishless pond communities. The effects were tested using presence and absence treatments of D. alaskanus in 24 mesocosms distributed among six ponds. We sampled phytoplankton, zooplankton and macroinvertebrates every two weeks for a six week period. Periphyton was sampled from the mesocosm walls on the final day. Total macroinvertebrate biomass decreased in the presence of dytiscids while species richness was not affected. Macroinvertebrate predators, snails and Gammarus lacustris decreased in the dytiscid treatments. Laboratory feeding experiments confirmed feeding preferences consistent with the mesocosm results. Periphyton biomass was six times greater in the dytiscid enclosures, concomitant with the decreased grazing by gastropods and other invertebrate primary consumers indicating a benthic trophic cascade. Top-down effects of dytiscids on other predatory invertebrates led to increased total zooplankton biomass, largely due to increased abundances of large and small cladocerans. Zooplankton species richness increased in the dytiscid enclosures. Inconsistent with trophic cascade theory, phytoplankton did not respond to top-down effects of D. alaskanus within the study period. Overall, the results show D. alaskanus predation caused trophic effects via two distinct food chains, a dytiscid-snail-periphyton trophic cascade, and a dytiscid-predatory macroinvertebrates-zooplankton partial trophic cascade. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2010.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {A common challenge in species conservation and management is how to incorporate species movements into management objectives. There often is a lack of knowledge of where, when, and why species move. The field of movement ecology has grown rapidly in the last decade and is now providing the knowledge needed to incorporate movements of species into management planning. This knowledge can also be used to develop management strategies that are flexible in time and space and may improve the effectiveness of management actions. Therefore, wildlife management and conservation may benefit by strengthening the link with movement ecology. We present a framework that illustrates how animal movement can be used to enhance conservation planning and identify management actions that are complementary to existing strategies. The framework contains five steps that identify (1) the movement attributes of a species, (2) their impacts on ecosystems, (3) how this knowledge can be used to guide the scale and type of management, (4) the implementation, and (5) the evaluation of management actions. We discuss these five steps in detail, highlighting why the step is important and how the information can be obtained. We illustrate the framework through a case study of managing a highly mobile species, the Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), a harvested species of conservation concern. We believe that the movement-management framework provides an important, and timely, link between movement ecology and wildlife management and conservation, and highlights the potential for complementary, dynamic solutions for managing wildlife.},

abstract = {The cross-edge spillover of subsidized predators from anthropogenic to natural habitats is an important process affecting wildlife, especially bird, populations in fragmented landscapes. However, the importance of the spillover of insect natural enemies from agricultural to natural habitats is unknown, despite the abundance of studies examining movement in the opposite direction. Here, we synthesize studies from various ecological sub-disciplines to suggest that spillover of agriculturally subsidized insect natural enemies may be an important process affecting prey populations in natural habitat fragments. This contention is based on (1) the ubiquity of agricultural-natural edges in human dominated landscapes; (2) the substantial literature illustrating that crop and natural habitats share important insect predators; and (3) the clear importance of the landscape matrix, specifically distance to ecological edges, in influencing predator impacts in agroecosystems. Further support emerges from theory on the importance of cross-boundary subsidies for within site consumer-resource dynamics. In particular, high productivity and temporally variable resource abundance in agricultural systems are predicted to result in strong spillover effects. More empirical work examining the prevalence and significance of such natural enemy spillover will be critical to a broader understanding of fragmentation impacts on insect predator-prey interactions. {\textcopyright} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {All gibbon species are globally threatened with extinction yet conservation efforts are undermined by a lack of population and ecological data. Agile gibbons (Hylobates agilis) occur in Sumatra, Indonesia and adjacent mainland Southeast Asia. Population densities are known from four sites (three in Sumatra) while little is known about their ability to tolerate habitat degradation. We conducted a survey of agile gibbons in Harapan Rainforest, a lowland forest site in Sumatra. The area has been severely degraded by selective logging and encroachment but is now managed for ecosystem restoration. We used two survey methods: an established point count method for gibbons with some modifications, and straight line transects using auditory detections. Surveys were conducted in the three main forest types prevalent at the site: high, medium, and low canopy cover secondary forests. Mean group density estimates were higher from point counts than from line transects, and tended to be higher in less degraded forests within the study site. We consider points more time efficient and reliable than transects since detectability of gibbons was higher from points per unit effort. We recommend the additional use of Distance sampling methods to account for imperfect detection and provide other recommendations to improve surveys of gibbons. We estimate that the site holds at least 6,070 and as many as 11,360 gibbons. Our results demonstrate that degraded forests can be extremely important for the conservation of agile gibbons and that efforts to protect and restore such sites could contribute significantly to the conservation of the species.

abstract = {Single species conservation unites disparate partners for the conservation of one species. However, there are widespread concerns that single species conservation biases conservation efforts towards charismatic species at the expense of others. Here we investigate the extent to which sage grouse (Centrocercus sp.) conservation, the largest public-private conservation effort for a single species in the US, provides protections for other species from localized and landscape-scale threats. We compared the coverage provided by sage grouse Priority Areas for Conservation (PACs) to 81 sagebrush-associated vertebrate species distributions with potential coverage under multi-species conservation prioritization generated using the decision support tool Zonation. PACs. We found that the current PAC prioritization approach was not statistically different from a diversity-based prioritization approach and covers 23.3{\%} of the landscape, and 24.8{\%}, on average, of the habitat of the 81 species. The proportion of each species distribution at risk was lower inside PACs as compared to the region as a whole, even without management (land use change 30{\%} lower, cheatgrass invasion 19{\%} lower). Whether or not bias away from threat represents the most efficient use of conservation effort is a matter of considerable debate, though may be pragmatic in this landscape where capacity to address these threats is limited. The approach outlined here can be used to evaluate biological equitability of protections provided by flagship species in other settings.},

Population projections are used to examine the sen- sitivity of Frazer's life table to variations in parameter estimates as well as the likely response of the population to various management alternatives.

We examined changes in macroinvertebrate communities caused by increased temperature (3°C above ambient during summer only and continuous 3°C above ambient all year round), influences of fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.) and addition of nutrients (nitrogen and phosphorus) in 48 large-scale (3000 l) tanks over a 2 year period. While numbers of Isopoda, Chaoborus, Corixidae, Ephemeroptera, Notonectidae and Odonata were reduced by the presence of fish, nutrient addition caused isopods, corixids, mayflies and odonates to increase in abundance. Impacts of temperature increase were surprisingly low, with only gastropods increasing in heated tanks, suggesting that, overall abundances of most macroinvertebrate taxa will not be severely affected by the predicted temperature rise. To determine if taxa were sampled representatively during the experiment, net sweep samples taken towards the end of the experiment were compared with final macroinvertebrate abundances when the complete contents of each tank were harvested. We found that net sweeping is an appropriate semi-quantitative method for most taxa in mesocosm tanks. However, mites, coleopteran adults and larvae, dipterans and Chaoborus were not adequately sampled. This might explain why we could not detect any treatment effects of temperature, fish or nutrients on mites, coleopterans and dipterans and calls for different sampling techniques for these taxa, especially in ponds with vegetation stands. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

This advancing research frontier, however, still lacks conceptual unification and has so far focused little on converse effects. Populations of moving animals have ubiquitous effects on processes such as nutrient cycling and seed dispersal and may therefore shape patterns of environmental predictability. Here, we synthesise the main strands of the literature on the feedbacks between environmental predictability and animal movement and discuss how they may react to anthropogenic disruption, leading to unexpected threats for wildlife and the environment.},

Review of how environmental predictibility can help with moovement ecology.
CONCLUSION
We lack a way of studying the interaction between environmental conditions and movement and we lack good environmental data. 
THE LINK BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL PREDICTABILITY AND ANIMAL MOVEMENT
The new knowledge we have about how enrionmental predictability has made species evolve and the technologies that we have now for biologging and remote sensing allow us to study better why organisms move. [my question is: how can the knowledge about the evolution of organisms allow us to study their moovement?]
The two-way link between environmental predictability and animal moovement could have a feedback loop that amplifies the predictability of the system or that dissipates it. [so? is there anything written in the test that says what researchers think about it at the moment?]

abstract = {The exchange of organisms and energy among ecosystems has major impacts on food web structure and dynamics, yet little is known about how climate warming combines with other pervasive anthropogenic perturbations to affect such exchanges. We used an outdoor freshwater mesocosm experiment to investigate the interactive effects of warming, eutrophication, and changes in top predators on the flux of biomass between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. We demonstrated that predatory fish decoupled aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems by reducing the emergence of aquatic organisms and suppressing the decomposition of terrestrial plant detritus. In contrast, warming and nutrients enhanced cross-ecosystem exchanges by increasing emergence and decomposition, and these effects were strongest in the absence of predators. Furthermore, we found that warming advanced while predators delayed the phenology of insect emergence. Our results demonstrate that anthropogenic perturbations may extend well beyond ecosystem boundaries by influencing cross-ecosystem subsidies. We find that these changes are sufficient to substantially impact recipient communities and potentially alter the carbon balance between aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems and the atmosphere. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) are frequent visitors to open space areas, but little is known about their ecological impacts. We studied the effects of dogs on wildlife by comparing the activity levels of wildlife in areas that prohibit dogs, with areas that allow dogs off-leash under “voice and sight” control. To measure wildlife activity both on trail and up to 200 m off-trail, we used four methods: pellet surveys, scented tracking plates, remote triggered cameras, and on-trail scat surveys. Additionally, in prairie dog (Cyonomys ludocivianus) colonies we measured the distances of prairie dog burrows to the nearest trail, and compared the density of prairie dog burrows between areas with and without dogs. The presence of dogs along recreational trails correlated with altered patterns of habitat utilization by several wildlife species. Mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) activity was significantly lower in proximity to trails in areas that allow dogs, and this effect extended at least 100 m off-trail. Small mammals, including squirrels (Sciurus spp.), rabbits (Sylviagus spp.), chipmunks (Eutamias spp.), and mice (Peromyscus spp., Reithrodontomys spp., Onychomys spp., Zapus spp.), also exhibited reduced levels of activity in proximity to trails in areas with dogs, and this effect extended at least 50 m off- trail. Furthermore, the density of prairie dog burrows was lower within 25 m of trails in areas that allow dogs. The presence of dogs also affected carnivore activity, although in varying ways. Red fox (Vulpes vulpes) detections were higher in areas that allowed dogs, and bobcat (Felis rufus) detections were lower. These findings have implications for the management of natural areas regarding dog policies, particularly those that allow dogs off- leash.},

There is, however, a widely held perception that birds benefit from extra food over winter, but that it is better that they 'look after themselves' during breeding. Here we describe a landscape-scale experiment showing for the first time that the effects of increasing food availability only during the winter can be carried over to the subsequent breeding season. Even though food supplementation stopped six weeks prior to breeding, birds living on sites provisioned over winter had advanced laying dates and increased fledging success compared with birds living on unprovisioned sites. Thus, supplemental feeding of wild birds during winter, in a manner mimicking householders provisioning in gardens and backyards, has the potential to alter bird population dynamics by altering future reproductive performance. With levels of bird feeding by the public continuing to increase, the impacts of this additional food supply on wild bird populations may be considerable.},

abstract = {We research scientists often worry about the future of our careers. Is our research an exciting path or a dead end that will end our careers prematurely? Predicting scientific trajectories is a daily task for hiring committees, funding agencies and department heads who probe CVs searching for signs of scientific potential. One popular measure of success is physicist Jorge Hirsch's h-index 1 , which captures the quality (citations) and quantity (number) of papers, thus representing scientific achievements better than either factor alone. A scientist has an h-index of n if he or she has published n articles receiving at least n citations each 2 . Einstein, Darwin and Feynman, for example, have impressive h-indices of 96, 63 and 53, respectively. According to Hirsch, an h-index of 12 for a physicist — meaning 12 papers with at least 12 citations each — could qualify him or her for tenure at a major university. However, the h-index 3 and similar metrics 4 can capture only past accomplishments, not future achievements 5 . Here we attempt to predict the future h-index of scientists on the basis of features found in most CVs. We maintain that the best way of predicting a scientist's future success is for peers to evaluate scientific contributions and research depth, but think that our methods could be valuable complementary tools. The typical research CV contains information on the number of publications, those in high-profile journals, the h-index and collaborators. One can also infer interdisciplinary breadth, the length and quality of training, the amount of funding received and even the standing of the scientist's PhD adviser. Such factors are taken into account for hiring decisions, but how should they be weighted? Fortunately, obtaining data on the scientific activities of individual researchers has never been easier. Using all of these features, we can begin to probe the scientific enterprise statistically.},

abstract = {Simulation models that describe autonomous individual organisms (individual based models, IBM) or agents (agent-based models, ABM) have become a widely used tool, not only in ecology, but also in many other disciplines dealing with complex systems made up of autonomous entities. However, there is no standard protocol for describing such simulation models, which can make them difficult to understand and to duplicate. This paper presents a proposed standard protocol, ODD, for describing IBMs and ABMs, developed and tested by 28 modellers who cover a wide range of fields within ecology. This protocol consists of three blocks (Overview, Design concepts, and Details), which are subdivided into seven elements: Purpose, State variables and scales, Process overview and scheduling, Design concepts, Initialization, Input, and Submodels. We explain which aspects of a model should be described in each element, and we present an example to illustrate the protocol in use. In addition, 19 examples are available in an Online Appendix. We consider ODD as a first step for establishing a more detailed common format of the description of IBMs and ABMs. Once initiated, the protocol will hopefully evolve as it becomes used by a sufficiently large proportion of modellers. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Experimental studies assessing climatic effects on ecological communities have typically applied static warming treatments. Although these studies have been informative, they have usually failed to incorporate either current or predicted future, patterns of variability. Future climates are likely to include extreme events which have greater impacts on ecological systems than changes in means alone. Here, we review the studies which have used experiments to assess impacts of temperature on marine, freshwater and terrestrial communities, and classify them into a set of 'generations' based on how they incorporate variability. The majority of studies have failed to incorporate extreme events. In terrestrial ecosystems in particular, experimental treatments have reduced temperature variability, when most climate models predict increased variability. Marine studies have tended to not concentrate on changes in variability, likely in part because the thermal mass of oceans will moderate variation. In freshwaters, climate change experiments have a much shorter history than in the other ecosystems, and have tended to take a relatively simple approach. We propose a new 'generation' of climate change experiments using down-scaled climate models which incorporate predicted changes in climatic variability, and describe a process for generating data which can be applied as experimental climate change treatments. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd/CNRS.},

Interactions with competitors, consumers, mutualists, and facilitators can strongly influence local species distributions, but few studies assess how and whether these interactions will impede or accelerate climate change-induced range shifts. In this paper, we explore how ecologists might move forward on this question. We first outline the conditions under which biotic interactions can result in range shifts that proceed faster or slower than climate velocity and result in ecological surprises. Next, we use our own work to demonstrate that experimental studies documenting the strength of biotic interactions across large environmental gradients are a critical first step for understanding whether they will influence climate change-induced range shifts. Further progress could be made by integrating results from these studies into modeling frameworks to predict how or generalize when biotic interactions mediate how changing climates influence range shifts. Finally, we argue that many more case studies like those described here are needed to explore the importance of biotic interactions during climate change-induced range shifts. {\textcopyright} 2013 New York Academy of Sciences.},

Extensive examples using R support graduate students and researchers in quantifying ecological niches and predicting species distributions with their own data, and help to address key environmental and conservation problems. Reflecting this highly active field of research, the book incorporates the latest developments from informatics and statistics, as well as using data from remote sources such as satellite imagery. A website at www.unil.ch/hsdm contains the codes and supporting material required to run the examples and teach courses. With applications in evolutionary biology, biogeography and conservation biology, the book emphasizes how these models can be used to make predictions in global and regional biodiversity assessments Written by highly experienced researchers in this active field, the book represents a contribution to strengthen modeling standards in basic and applied habitat suitability model research The most recent developments in informatics, statistics and data manipulation in R are incorporated.},

Although webs were often initially reported in despair at ever understanding ecological complexity, recently discovered widespread patterns in the shapes of webs, and theoretical explanations for these patterns, indicate that webs are orderly and intelligible, and have some foreseeable consequences for the dynamics of communities. FOOD webs are the road-maps through Darwin's famous 'entangled bank' 1 and have a long history in ecology 2. Like maps of unfamiliar ground, food webs appear bewilderingly complex. They were often published to make just that point. Yet recent studies have shown that food webs from a wide range of terrestrial , freshwater, and marine communities share a remarkable list of patterns. Current research concentrates on how many independent patterns there are, how they may be described quantitatively, why the patterns are so general, and what are the consequences of these patterns for the dynamics of a community and its constituent species. Just as any map omits details, most published webs omit predation on minor species, the quantities of food consumed, the chemical composition and temporal variation of the flows and many other details. Published webs are also of very variable quality. These omissions and problems are causes of concern, but on present evidence do not present insurmountable difficulties.},

Recent work has emphasized the consequences of downsizing in animal communities for ecosystem functioning. However, no study so far has integrated network theory and life-history trade-offs to mechanistically evaluate the functional consequences of defaunation in plant–animal networks. Here, we simulated an avian seed-dispersal network and its derived ecosystem function seedling recruitment to assess the relative importance of different size-related mechanisms. Specifically, we considered size matching (between bird size and seed size) and size trade-offs, which are driven by differences in plant or animal species abundance (negative size– quantity relationship) as well as in recruitment probability and disperser quality (positive size–quality relationship). Defaunation led to impoverished seedling communities in terms of diversity and seed size, but only if models accounted for size matching. In addition, size trade-off in plants, in concert with size matching, provoked rapid decays in seedling abundance in response to defaunation. These results underscore a disproportional importance of large animals for ecosystem functions. Downsizing in ecological networks will have severe consequences for ecosystem functioning, especially in interaction networks that are structured by size matching between plants and animals.},

Gabon and the Republic of Congo alone are thought to hold roughly 80{\%} of the world's gorillas and most of the common chimpanzees. Here we present survey results conservatively indicating that ape populations in Gabon declined by more than half between 1983 and 2000. The primary cause of the decline in ape numbers during this period was commercial hunting, facilitated by the rapid expansion of mechanized logging. Furthermore, Ebola haemorrhagic fever is currently spreading through ape populations in Gabon and Congo and now rivals hunting as a threat to apes. Gorillas and common chimpanzees should be elevated immediately to 'critically endangered' status. Without aggressive investments in law enforcement, protected area management and Ebola prevention, the next decade will see our closest relatives pushed to the brink of extinction.},

The consumption in bushmeat depended by how much the zone is close to the forest were chimpanzee can be caught. 

The researchers suggest that who makes laws for chimpanzee should invest their effort into protecting the area in which chimpanzee are more aboundant.

abstract = {Coextinction models are useful to understand community robustness to species loss and resilience to disturbances. We simulated pollinator extinctions in pollination networks by using a hybrid model that combined a recently developed stochastic coextinction model (SCM) for plant extinctions and a topological model (TCM) for animal extinctions. Our model accounted for variation in interaction strengths and included empirical estimates of plant dependence on pollinators to set seeds. The stochastic nature of such model allowed us determining plant survival to single (and multiple) extinction events, and identifying which pollinators (keystone species) were more likely to trigger secondary extinctions. Consistently across three different pollinator removal sequences, plant robustness was lower than in a pure TCM, and plant survival was more determined by dependence on the mutualism than by interaction strength. As expected, highly connected and dependent plants were the most sensitive to pollinator loss and collapsed faster in extinction cascades. We predict that the relationship between dependence and plant connectivity is crucial to determine network robustness to interaction loss. Finally, we showed that honeybees and several beetles were keystone species in our communities. This information is of great value to foresee consequences of pollinator losses facing current global change and to identify target species for effective conservation.},

abstract = {As terrestrial leaf litter decomposes in rivers, its constituent elements follow multiple pathways. Carbon leached as dissolved organic matter can be quickly taken up by microbes, then respired before it can be transferred to the macroscopic food web. Alternatively, this detrital carbon can be ingested and assimilated by aquatic invertebrates, so it is retained longer in the stream and transferred to higher trophic levels. Microbial growth on litter can affect invertebrates through three pathways, which are not mutually exclusive. First, microbes can facilitate invertebrate feeding, improving food quality by conditioning leaves and making them more palatable for invertebrates. Second, microbes can be prey for invertebrates. Third, microbes can compete with invertebrates for resources bound within litter and may produce compounds that retard carbon and nitrogen fluxes to invertebrates. As litter is broken down into smaller particles, there are many opportunities for its elements to reenter the stream food web. Here, I describe a conceptual framework for evaluating how traits of leaf litter will affect its fate in food webs and ecosystems that is useful for predicting how global change will alter carbon fluxes into and out of streams.},

abstract = {Biodiversity is organised into complex ecological networks of interacting species in local ecosystems, but our knowledge about the effects of habitat fragmentation on such systems remains limited. We consider the effects of this key driver of both local and global change on both mutualistic and antagonistic systems at different levels of biological organisation and spatiotemporal scales.There is a complex interplay of patterns and processes related to the variation and influence of spatial, temporal and biotic drivers in ecological networks. Species traits (e.g. body size, dispersal ability) play an important role in determining how networks respond to fragment size and isolation, edge shape and permeability, and the quality of the surrounding landscape matrix. Furthermore, the perception of spatial scale (e.g. environmental grain) and temporal effects (time lags, extinction debts) can differ markedly among species, network modules and trophic levels, highlighting the need to develop a more integrated perspective that considers not just nodes, but the structural role and strength of species interactions (e.g. as hubs, spatial couplers and determinants of connectance, nestedness and modularity) in response to habitat fragmentation.Many challenges remain for improving our understanding: the likely importance of specialisation, functional redundancy and trait matching has been largely overlooked. The potentially critical effects of apex consumers, abundant species and super-generalists on network changes and evolutionary dynamics also need to be addressed in future research. Ultimately, spatial and ecological networks need to be combined to explore the effects of dispersal, colonisation, extinction and habitat fragmentation on network structure and coevolutionary dynamics. Finally, we need to embed network approaches more explicitly within applied ecology in general, because they offer great potential for improving on the current species-based or habitat-centric approaches to our management and conservation of biodiversity in the face of environmental change. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Introduction Climate change, overexploitation of natural populations, invasive species, and habitat degradation are affecting species and ecosystems all over the world on a scale that is predicted to lead to the sixth mass extinction (Barnosky et al., 2011). Such dramatic perturbations to ecological communities are likely to affect the structure, functioning, and stability of ecosystems (Montoya et al., 2006; Pereira et al., 2010: Isbell et al., 2011; Hooper et al., 2012), invoking the important question if changes to, or even loss of, some species can be expected to have more far-reaching consequences than others. Or put another way: are some species more important than others in upholding the structure and functioning of ecological systems? Despite the urgency of this question, our understanding of the contribution of different species to community structure and functioning is incomplete and contradictory. For example, some models describing patterns in ecosystems suggest that all species are “equivalent” (i.e., differences are neutral with respect to community properties, e.g., MacArthur and Wilson, 1967; Hubbell, 2001), while others suggest that some nodes are disproportionately important for maintaining community structure and functioning (Saavedra et al., 2011) and can be considered keystone species (Paine, 1966, 1969; Cottee-Jones and Whittaker, 2012). Due to the practical and ethical constraints associated with perturbing species in real ecosystems, many researchers have used theoretical approaches to address these questions, for example studying the effect of small as well as large disturbances (Curtsdotter et al., 2011; Berg et al., 2015; Jonsson et al., 2015) to different kinds of species in model communities and monitoring the response. Theoretical studies of species extinctions have among other things documented the obvious importance of highly connected species for the permanence of the remaining food web (Ekl{\"{o}}f and Ebenman, 2006), and identified large body size, high trophic position, low vulnerability, or low numerical abundance (Berg et al., 2015) as traits of potential keystone species that, if lost, are likely to cause cascades of secondary extinctions (Borrvall et al., 2000; Ebenman and Jonsson, 2005). Here we also use a theoretical approach to look for species that, when perturbed, will affect a community more than others, and analyze if there are species with particular attributes whose ecological importance currently are under-appreciated. One such attribute might be the abundance of a species.},

However, the foundational assumption-that drivers of spatial gradients of species composition also drive temporal changes in diversity-rarely is tested. Here, we empirically test the space-for-time assumption by constructing orthogonal datasets of compositional turnover of plant taxa and climatic dissimilarity through time and across space from Late Quaternary pollen records in eastern North America, then modeling climate-driven compositional turnover. Predictions relying on space-for-time substitution were 72{\%} as accurate as "time-for-time" predictions. However, space-for-time substitution performed poorly during the Holocene when temporal variation in climate was small relative to spatial variation and required subsampling to match the extent of spatial and temporal climatic gradients. Despite this caution, our results generally support the judicious use of space-for-time substitution in modeling community responses to climate change.},

The loss of a species is expected to result in the loss of other species that depend on it (coextinction), leading to cascading effects across trophic levels.

Paradoxically, few historical or contemporary coextinction events have actually been recorded. We review the current knowledge of coextinction by: (i) considering plausible explanations for the discrepancy between predicted and observed coextinction rates; (ii) exploring the potential consequences of coextinctions; (iii) discussing the interactions and synergies between coextinction and other drivers of species loss, particularly climate change; and (iv) suggesting the way forward for understanding the phenomenon of coextinction, which may well be the most insidious threat to global biodiversity. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society.},

@article{Kefi2017,
abstract = {Introduction In drylands, there is often not enough water for the whole land to be covered by vegetation. Instead, vegetation occurs in patches (Figure 6.1a), where established plants provide a favorable environment for the recruitment of new individuals, for example, by creating shading and locally favoring soil and resource retention (Aguiar and Sala, 1999). This facilitation mechanism is well documented in drylands and known to be of great importance for dryland plant communities (Soliveres et al., 2015). At the same time, plant species compete with each other for water, the main limiting resource in those ecosystems, and are consumed by herbivores. This is only one example of the variety of ecological interactions that co-occur in ecological communities (Figure 6.1b, c). As early as 1859, Charles Darwin highlighted the diverse interaction types that link species in nature. One of his famous examples on how cats influence seed set in red clover (Darwin, 1859) illustrates how indirect effects can percolate through a variety of ecological interactions that co-occur in ecological communities. Cats eating mice is a trophic interaction, mice building nests that are later used by bumble bees is an ecological engineering interaction, and these bees in turn increasing seed set in clover is a mutualistic pollination interaction. Despite the recognized importance of this variety of interaction types in nature, ecological research has largely focused on analyzing one single type of interaction at a time, for example trophic networks or food webs (Pimm, 1982; Cohen et al., 1993; de Ruiter et al., 1995; Brose et al., 2005, 2006; Neutel et al., 2007), mutualistic communities (Jordano et al., 2003; Bl{\"{u}}thgen et al., 2007), host–parasite and host–parasitoids webs (V{\'{a}}zquez et al., 2005; Krasnov et al., 2012), and facilitation networks (Verd{\'{u}} and Valiente-Banuet, 2008). Studies on networks of single interaction types – greatly dominated by food-web studies (e.g., Ings et al., 2009) – have suggested that single-interaction ecological networks exhibit predictable structural regularities with important consequences for their dynamics (Williams and Martinez, 2000; Bascompte et al., 2003; Montoya et al., 2006; Verd{\'{u}} and Valiente-Banuet, 2008; Th{\'{e}}bault and Fontaine, 2010). For example, mutualistic (Bascompte et al., 2003) and facilitation networks (Verd{\'{u}} and Valiente-Banuet, 2008) tend to be more nested than expected by chance, a feature that has been shown to give rise to positive complexity–stability relationships in dynamic models (Okuyama and Holland, 2008; Th{\'{e}}bault and Fontaine, 2010).},

abstract = {The sustained decline in habitat quality and community integrity highlights the importance of understanding how communities and environmental variation interactively contribute to ecosystem services. We performed a laboratory experiment manipulating effects of acclimation temperature (5, 15, 25, and 35°C) on resource acquisition, assimilation and subsequent ecosystem services provided by eight freshwater mussel species. Our results suggest that although freshwater mussels are broadly categorized as filter feeders, there are distinct nested functional guilds (thermally tolerant and sensitive) associated with their thermal performance. At 35°C, thermally tolerant species have increased resource assimilation and higher rates of contributed ecosystem services (nutrient excretion, benthic-pelagic coupling). Conversely, thermally sensitive species have decreased assimilation rates and display an array of functional responses including increased/decreased benthic-pelagic coupling and nutrient excretion. Although thermally sensitive species may be in poorer physiological condition at warmer temperatures, their physiological responses can have positive effects on ecosystem services. We extrapolated these results to real mussel beds varying in species composition to address how shifts in community composition coupled with climate change may shift their contributed ecological services. Comparative field data indicate that two co-existing, abundant species with opposing thermal performance (Actinonaias ligamentina, Amblema plicata) differentially dominate community biomass. Additionally, communities varying in the relative proportion of these species differentially influence the magnitude (benthic-pelagic coupling) and quality (N:P excretion) of ecosystem services. As species are increasingly threatened by climate change, greater emphasis should be placed on understanding the contribution of physiological stress to the integrity and functioning of ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

We argue that this progress arises from three key characteristics of long-term research. First, long-term data are necessary to observe the heterogeneity that drives most population processes. Second, long-term studies often inherently lead to novel insights. Finally, long-term field studies can serve as model systems for population biology, allowing for theory and methods to be tested under well-characterized conditions. We illustrate these ideas in three long-term field systems that have made outsized contributions to our understanding of population ecology, evolution, and conservation biology. We then highlight three emerging areas to which long-term field studies are well positioned to contribute in the future: ecological forecasting, genomics, and macrosystems ecology. Overcoming the obstacles associated with maintaining long-term studies requires continued emphasis on recognizing the benefits of such studies to ensure that long-term research continues to have a substantial impact on elucidating population biology.Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics, Volume 50 is November 4, 2019.

abstract = {1. Few detailed long-term data sets exist for fresh waters with which to examine large-scale temporal changes in community composition. Consequently, insight into community persistence has been restricted to a few, contingent case studies. We collated and analysed data for the aquatic macroinvertebrate community of Broadstone Stream in south-east England, spanning three decades. The pH of this naturally acid stream has risen progressively since the 1970s, and we sought to examine the potential effects of this environmental change upon the community. 2. Persistence within Broadstone was high when compared with other systems that have been analysed using similar methods. The stream was characterised by a 'core' community of eight taxa that were always present, and contributed 75-97{\%} of total invertebrate abundance, with a trailing limb of progressively rarer and more acid-sensitive taxa. There was little species turnover, although the time-series exceeded 20 generations for most species. 3. Despite this high persistence, a long-term response to rising pH was detected: species indicating profound acidity (identified a priori from independent studies) have declined since the 1970s, whereas indicators of moderate acidity increased. The structure of the community food web has also changed since the 1970s, with increased predator diversity and abundance, and a lengthening of food chains following the invasion of a new top predator. 4. These changes in the community appeared to be driven by an interaction between pH and climate. The unusually hot, dry summers characteristic of the 1990s may have raised pH during the more sensitive (i.e. early) stages of the life-cycle, and thus provided a window of opportunity for less acid-tolerant taxa to colonise and become established. Changes in pH appeared to set the boundaries of the available local species pool, within which biotic interactions ultimately shaped the community.},

Despite this, it is not known how the different food webs in adjacent habitats assemble at their boundaries. Here we demonstrate that the composition and structure of herbivore-parasitoid food webs across edges between native and plantation forests are not randomly assembled from those of the adjacent communities. Rather, elevated proportions of abundant, interaction-generalist parasitoid species at habitat edges allowed considerable interaction rewiring, which led to higher linkage density and less modular networks, with higher parasitoid functional redundancy. This was despite high overlap in host composition between edges and interiors. We also provide testable hypotheses for how food webs may assemble between habitats with lower species overlap. In an increasingly fragmented world, non-random assembly of food webs at edges may increasingly affect community dynamics at the landscape level.},

abstract = {It is widely accepted that global warming will adversely affect ecological communities. As ecosystems are simultaneously exposed to other anthropogenic influences, it is important to address the effects of climate change in the context of many stressors. Nutrient enrichment might offset some of the energy demands that warming can exert on organisms by stimulating growth at the base of the food web. It is important to know whether indirect effects of warming will be as ecologically significant as direct physiological effects. Declining body size is increasingly viewed as a universal response to warming, with the potential to alter trophic interactions. To address these issues, we used an outdoor array of marine mesocosms to examine the impacts of warming, nutrient enrichment and altered top-predator body size on a community comprised of the predator (shore crab Carcinus maenas), various grazing detritivores (amphipods) and algal resources. Warming increased mortality rates of crabs, but had no effect on their moulting rates. Nutrient enrichment and warming had near diametrically opposed effects on the assemblage, confirming that the ecological effects of these two stressors can cancel each other out. This suggests that nutrient-enriched systems might act as an energy refuge to populations of species under metabolic constraints due to warming. While there was a strong difference in assemblages between mesocosms containing crabs compared to mesocosms without crabs, decreasing crab size had no detectable effect on the amphipod or algal assemblages. This suggests that in allometrically balanced communities, the expected long-term effect of warming (declining body size) is not of similar ecological consequence to the direct physiological effects of warming, at least not over the six week duration of the experiment described here. More research is needed to determine the long-term effects of declining body size on the bioenergetic balance of natural communities.},

As the category size increases the sampling error decreases, but the error of distribution increases. The method doesn't apply to species which have biologically defined stages. It's posteriori.It has been citeted in a lot of other papers. Check out a generalized algorithm for determining category size 1986 (Revision and extinction of choosing category size).
A PROPOSED SOLUTION 
The autor tries to find the optimal category size.However, a problem sussits. The 2 errors have 2 different natures. It possible to find it through an empirical experiment. 
AN EXAMPLE
The example uses unrealistic data.
DISCUSSION
The method works but it's a posteriori. It's not supposed to be used with species that can be subdivided into categories.},

Ecologists have investigated both the influence of environmental variables on species diversity and the influence of species diversity on ecosystem function and stability. These investigations have largely been carried out without taking into account the overarching stabilizing structures of food webs that arise from evolutionary and successional processes and that are maintained through species interactions. Here, we argue that the same large-scale structures that have been purported to convey stability to food webs can also help to understand both the distribution of species diversity in nature and the relationship between species diversity and food web stability. Specifically, the allocation of species diversity to slow energy channels within food webs results in the skewed distribution of interactions strengths that has been shown to confer stability to complex food webs. We end by discussing the processes that might generate and maintain the structured, stable and diverse food webs observed in nature. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {1.Many taxa can be found in food webs that differ in trophic complexity, but it is unclear how trophic complexity affects the performance of particular taxa. In pond food webs, larvae of the salamander Ambystoma opacum occupy the intermediate predator trophic position in a partial intraguild predation (IGP) food web and can function as keystone predators. Larval A. opacum are also found in simpler food webs lacking either top predators or shared prey. 2.We conducted an experiment where a partial IGP food web was simplified, and we measured the growth and survival of larval A. opacum in each set of food webs. Partial IGP food webs that had either a low abundance or high abundance of total prey were also simplified by independently removing top predators and/or shared prey. 3.Removing top predators always increased A. opacum survival, but removal of shared prey had no effect on A. opacum survival, regardless of total prey abundance. 4.Surprisingly, food web simplification had no effect on the growth of A. opacum when present in food webs with a low abundance of prey but had important effects on A. opacum growth in food webs with a high abundance of prey. Simplifying a partial IGP food web with a high abundance of prey reduced A. opacum growth when either top predators or shared prey were removed from the food web and the loss of top predators and shared prey influenced A. opacum growth in a non-additive fashion. 5.The non-additive response in A. opacum growth appears to be the result of supplemental prey availability augmenting the beneficial effects of top predators. Top predators had a beneficial effect on A. opacum populations by reducing the abundance of A. opacum present and thereby reducing the intensity of intraspecific competition. 6.Our study indicates that the effects of food web simplification on the performance of A. opacum are complex and depend on both how a partial IGP food web is simplified and how abundant prey are in the food web. These findings are important because they demonstrate how trophic complexity can create variation in the performance of intermediate predators that play important roles in temporary pond food webs. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {Promoting recreation and preserving wildlife are often dual missions for land managers, yet recreation may impact wildlife. Because individual disturbances are seemingly inconsequential, it is difficult to convince the public that there is a conservation value to restricting recreation to reduce disturbance. We studied threatened western snowy plovers (Charadrius alexandrinus nivosus) at a public beach (Sands Beach, Coal Oil Point Reserve) in Santa Barbara, California (USA) before and during a period when a barrier directed foot traffic away from a section of upper beach where snowy plovers roost. The barrier reduced disturbance rates by more than half. Snowy plovers increased in abundance (throughout the season) and their distribution contracted to within the protected area. Snowy plovers that were outside the protected area in the morning moved inside as people began using the beach. Experiments with quail eggs indicated an 8{\%} daily risk of nest trampling outside the protected area. Before protection, plovers did not breed at Coal Oil Point. During protection, snowy plovers bred in increasing numbers each year and had high success at fledging young. These results demonstrate how recreational disturbance can degrade habitat for shorebirds and that protecting quality habitat may have large benefits for wildlife and small impacts to recreation. {\textcopyright}Springer 2006.},

The importance of biodiversity might be enhanced when multiple ecosystem processes (termed multifunctionality) and environmental contexts are considered, yet no studies have quantified this explicitly to date. We measured five key processes and their combined multifunctionality at three temperatures (5, 10 and 15 °C) in freshwater aquaria containing different animal assemblages (1-4 benthic macroinvertebrate species). For single processes, biodiversity effects were weak and were best predicted by additive-based models, i.e. polyculture performances represented the sum of their monoculture parts. There were, however, significant effects of biodiversity on multifunctionality at the low and the high (but not the intermediate) temperature. Variation in the contribution of species to processes across temperatures meant that greater biodiversity was required to sustain multifunctionality across different temperatures than was the case for single processes. This suggests that previous studies might have underestimated the importance of biodiversity in sustaining ecosystem functioning in a changing environment.},

abstract = {Climate change is asymmetrically altering environmental conditions in space, from local to global scales, creating novel heterogeneity. Here, we argue that this novel heterogeneity will drive mobile generalist consumer species to rapidly respond through their behaviour in ways that broadly and predictably reorganize — or rewire — food webs. We use existing theory and data from diverse ecosystems to show that the rapid behavioural responses of generalists to climate change rewire food webs in two distinct and critical ways. First, mobile generalist species are redistributing into systems where they were previously absent and foraging on new prey, resulting in topological rewiring — a change in the patterning of food webs due to the addition or loss of connections. Second, mobile generalist species, which navigate between habitats and ecosystems to forage, will shift their relative use of differentially altered habitats and ecosystems, causing interaction strength rewiring — changes that reroute energy and carbon flows through existing food web connections and alter the food web's interaction strengths. We then show that many species with shared traits can exhibit unified aggregate behavioural responses to climate change, which may allow us to understand the rewiring of whole food webs. We end by arguing that generalists' responses present a powerful and underutilized approach to understanding and predicting the consequences of climate change and may serve as much-needed early warning signals for monitoring the looming impacts of global climate change on entire ecosystems.},

abstract = {Variability in population growth rate is thought to have negative consequences for organism fitness. Theory for matrix population models predicts that variance in population growth rate should be the sum of the variance in each matrix entry times the squared sensitivity term for that matrix entry. I analyzed the stage-specific demography of 30 field populations from 17 published studies for pattern between the variance of a demographic term and its contribution to population growth. There were no instances in which a matrix entry both was highly variable and had a large effect on population growth rate; instead, correlations between estimates of temporal variance in a term and contribution to population growth (sensitivity or elasticity) were overwhelmingly negative. In addition, survivorship or growth sensitivities or elasticities always exceeded those of fecundity, implying that the former two terms always contributed more to population growth rate. These results suggest that variable life history stages tend to contribute relatively little to population growth rates because natural selection may alter life histories to minimize stages with both high sensitivity and high variation.},
annote = {INTRODUCTION 
The author says that the most appealing characteristic of the matrix population models is that they enable ecologists to study with what percentage the different life stages contribut to shape the population growth.
She says that has been already used to study harvesting and endangered species.
It's really interesting that the author introduces the variation of parameters associated to the values ofthe matrix. 
Then she provides the mathematical tools to estimate population growth variance knowing the sensitivity of the an entry.
She uses the term sensitivity and elasticity as synonyms, which according to Haswell are not.
She says that if the parameters that contribut the most to population growth will be sensitive, also the population growth will have a great variance. 
The author tries to find if a specifical trait contributes in a specific way to population growth. 
METHODS
RESULTS
DISCUSSION
The author found out that the highest variance a specific trait presents, the lowest its contribution of to the population growth is.
This has been dimonstrated studying algae, terrestrial plants, vertebrates, acquatic invertebrates. 
Fencundity tended to have the highest variability and the lowest sensitivity and elasticity.
It cites Silvertown work.


In this study, I searched for general patterns in life history variation in published demographic studies that used matrix models. Although matrix model entries do not always corre- spond directly with a life history trait (e.g., variance in the timing of first reproduction is difficult to explore in a matrix model; ref. 44), published matrix models represent a logical starting point to ask whether there are patterns between variability in a demographic term and its contribution to population growth. Thus, among a wide variety of taxa, I first explored whether there was a relationship between temporal variation in demographic terms and the sensitivity or elasticity of those terms. 
Specifically, I explored whether there were correlates among demographic terms such that variance in population growth rate was minimized. 

The author tested the hypotesis that variability in population growth rate is related to low individual fitness. She tried to find if there was a demographic term associated to a low variance in population growth. Comparing different organisms she found out that 


I then used those same studies to search for patterns in how survivorship, growth, and fecundity sensitivity and elasticity terms were ranked among different organisms. This final analysis provided a means of determining whether there are consistent patterns among certain life history groupings and their contribution to popu- lation growth.},

abstract = {A central challenge in community ecology is to understand the connection between biodiversity and the functioning of ecosystems. While traditional approaches have largely focused on species-level diversity, increasing evidence indicates that there exists substantial ecological diversity among individuals within species. By far, the largest source of this intraspecific diversity stems from variation among individuals in ontogenetic stage and size. Although such ontogenetic shifts are ubiquitous in natural communities, whether and how they scale up to influence the structure and functioning of complex ecosystems is largely unknown. Here we take an experimental approach to examine the consequences of ontogenetic niche shifts for the structure of communities and ecosystem processes. In particular we experimentally manipulated the stage structure in a keystone predator, larvae of the dragonfly Anax Junius, in complex experimental pond communities to test whether changes in the population stage or size structure of a keystone species scale up to alter community structure and ecosystem processes, and how functional differences scale with relative differences in size among stages. We found that the functional role of A.junius was stage-specific. Altering what stages were present in a pond led to concurrent changes in community structure, primary producer biomass (periphyton and phytoplankton), and ultimately altered ecosystem processes (respiration and net primary productivity), indicating a strong, but stage-specific, trophic cascade. Interestingly, the stage-specific effects did not simply scale with size or biomass of the predator, but instead indicated clear ontogenetic niche shifts in ecological interactions. Thus, functional differences among stages within a keystone species scaled up to alter the functioning of entire ecosystems. Therefore, our results indicate that the classical approach of assuming an average functional role of a species can be misleading because functional roles are dynamic and will change with shifts in the stage structure of the species. In general this emphasizes the importance of accounting for functional diversity below the species level to predict how natural and anthropogenic changes alter the functioning of natural ecosystems.},

abstract = {1. Top-down control can be an important determinant of ecosystem structure and function, but in oceanic ecosystems, where cascading effects of predator depletions, recoveries, and invasions could be significant, such effects had rarely been demonstrated until recently. 2. Here we synthesize the evidence for oceanic top-down control that has emerged over the last decade, focusing on large, high trophic-level predators inhabiting continental shelves, seas, and the open ocean. 3. In these ecosystems, where controlled manipulations are largely infeasible, 'pseudo-experimental' analyses of predator-prey interactions that treat independent predator populations as 'replicates', and temporal or spatial contrasts in predator populations and climate as 'treatments', are increasingly employed to help disentangle predator effects from environmental variation and noise. 4. Substantial reductions in marine mammals, sharks, and piscivorous fishes have led to mesopredator and invertebrate predator increases. Conversely, abundant oceanic predators have suppressed prey abundances. Predation has also inhibited recovery of depleted species, sometimes through predator-prey role reversals. Trophic cascades have been initiated by oceanic predators linking to neritic food webs, but seem inconsistent in the pelagic realm with effects often attenuating at plankton. 5. Top-down control is not uniformly strong in the ocean, and appears contingent on the intensity and nature of perturbations to predator abundances. Predator diversity may dampen cascading effects except where nonselective fisheries deplete entire predator functional groups. In other cases, simultaneous exploitation of predator and prey can inhibit prey responses. Explicit consideration of anthropogenic modifications to oceanic foodwebs should help inform predictions about trophic control. 6. Synthesis and applications. Oceanic top-down control can have important socio-economic, conservation, and management implications as mesopredators and invertebrates assume dominance, and recovery of overexploited predators is impaired. Continued research aimed at integrating across trophic levels is needed to understand and forecast the ecosystem effects of changing oceanic predator abundances, the relative strength of top-down and bottom-up control, and interactions with intensifying anthropogenic stressors such as climate change. {\textcopyright} 2009 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {Attached epiphytes often make important contributions to total primary production in seagrass meadows. Additionally, they may increase the spatial complexity of seagrass habitats. Experiments conducted using artificial seagrass units (ASU) manipulated both epiphytic structure and epiphytic food resources. Previous work suggested that the increase in faunal density associated with epiphytes was related to increases in structure, but our results indicate that the primary impact of epiphytes lies in their trophic role. Data showed that epifaunal density was significantly greater in conditioned ASUs fouled with a live community of epiphytes (12 285 individuals m−2) compared to ASUs with artificially created epiphytic structure (5099 inds. m−2) and to control ASUs (5955 inds. m−2). This response to epiphytic trophic resources was significant for most herbivore/omnivore taxa, but not necessarily for filter feeding or predatory epifauna. However, densities of two predatory taxa (fish and mud crabs) were significantly greater where epiphytic biomass was higher, which may reflect their response to increased prey abundance. Additionally, ASUs conditioned with live epiphytes had greater taxa richness than other ASUs. Epiphytic structure appeared to play only a limited role in determining the density of most mobile epifauna, but epiphytic structure appeared to be important in augmenting the settlement of bivalves. By using ASUs we were able to control aspects of blade length and shoot density, but the pre-experiment conditioning of treatments fouled with live epiphytes may have played a role in determining absolute differences in macrofaunal density among ASU treatments. Overall, our work suggests that the trophic role of epiphytes can have a dramatic impact on associated epifaunal communities, although future investigations are needed to assess this relationship more fully.},

Accordingly, we revise the definition of ODD to clarify aspects of the original version and thereby facilitate future standardization of ABM descriptions. We discuss frequently raised critiques in ODD but also two emerging, and unanticipated, benefits: ODD improves the rigorous formulation of models and helps make the theoretical foundations of large models more visible.

All plants ≥5 cm in height were identified and counted; large plants were also measured and ground cover was surveyed. Major macronutrients, pH, macro-elements/base cations, micronutrients and pedogenic elements, and thermodynamic stability levels were quantified from soil samples taken at each transect.Results: Even in a low diversity atoll environment, we found that high abundances of C. nucifera corresponded with pronounced differences in forest communities including: lower diversity of established trees and regenerating understorey; higher stem density and stand basal area; lower abundance of major macronutrients; and differences in macro and trace elements and energy content of soil organic matter. Historical natural experiments document that the expansion of C. nucifera was the likely causative agent of these changes.Discussion: Cumulatively, these data show that C. nucifera has important impacts on floristic, structural and soil characteristics of forests where it becomes dominant. Given the high proportion of tropical coastal areas in which C. nucifera is now naturalized and abundant, this likely has important implications for coastal forest diversity and structure. {\textcopyright} 2010 International Association for Vegetation Science.},

abstract = {Many of the species at greatest risk of extinction from anthropogenic climate change are narrow endemics that face insurmountable dispersal barriers. In this review, I argue that the only viable option to maintain populations of these species in the wild is to translocate them to other locations where the climate is suitable. Risks of extinction to native species in destination areas are small, provided that translocations take place within the same broad geographic region and that the destinations lack local endemics. Biological communities in these areas are in the process of receiving many hundreds of other immigrant species as a result of climate change; ensuring that some of the 'new' inhabitants are climate-endangered species could reduce the net rate of extinction. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Many primate species are threatened with extinction and are the focus of extensive conservation efforts including re-introduction, captive breeding and habitat conservation. Welfare-based rehabilitation (hereafter also 'rehabilitation') is a management strategy commonly used for primates, particularly those species targeted by the pet and bush meat trades. Rehabilitation of rescued primates typically has the dual motivation of welfare and conservation, but has not been assessed as a conservation strategy. As the species involved in rehabilitation are often endangered (e.g. chimpanzees, gorillas, orang-utans), it is important for rehabilitation projects to follow a 'best practice' model in order to increase positive outcomes. In this study, we compared the approaches of 28 welfare-based primate rehabilitation projects to the 'IUCN guidelines for nonhuman primate re-introductions', in addition to components of the 'Best practice guidelines for the re-introduction of great apes' in order to assess where additional work might be needed for released animals to contribute to conservation outcomes. Few projects examined complied with the guidelines for re-introduction, failing to incorporate important factors such as quarantine, long term post-release monitoring and training for predator awareness. Further development of species-specific rehabilitation guidelines may improve the outcomes of future rehabilitation projects. To support this, we recommend that detailed methods and results be published for all rehabilitation efforts, regardless of the outcome.},

The increasing intensity of anthropogenic forces in the twenty-first century has widespread implications for attempts to govern both human-dominated ecosystems and the last remaining wild ecosystems. Here, we review how evolutionary biology can inform governance and policies in the Anthropocene, focusing on five governance challenges that span biodiversity, environmental management, food and other biomass production, and human health. The five challenges are: ( a) evolutionary feedbacks, ( b) maintaining resilience, ( c) alleviating constraints, ( d) coevolutionary disruption, and ( e) biotechnology. Strategies for governing these dynamics will themselves have to be coevolutionary, as eco-evolutionary and social dynamics change in response to each other.Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics, Volume 50 is November 4, 2019.

abstract = {An estimated 63{\%} of Southeast Asian forests are classed as disturbed and secondary as a result of human activity. Many of these forests remain important for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem services so there is much interest in their capacity for restoration. The role of larger animals as seed dispersers in natural regeneration is well-attested since they are often the only agent by which large-seeded trees can effectively disperse. This is especially important for late successional shade-tolerant species which might otherwise be excluded from disturbed sites. However, many larger animals are sensitive to habitat degradation so may be lost from the very areas that require them. We investigated the persistence of a suite of large mammals that are known seed-dispersers and are also threatened species, in a degraded site in lowland south-central Sumatra. We used camera traps and field observations to relate their distributions to prevailing vegetation conditions. Although most species were more frequently detected in the more intact areas, most were able to occupy habitats with high levels of disturbance and population densities were relatively high. It is clear that severe habitat degradation does not necessarily lead to the immediate loss of large-bodied seed dispersers, so ensuring adequate protection for these species from external threats, such as hunting, must be built into management plans for restoration concessions.},

Identifying the roles of species on ecological network robustness is an effective way to conserve biodiversity. Previous studies have mostly focused on the role of an individual species in the whole food web. They ignored the truth that food webs consist of a large number of motifs (patterns of interconnections occurring in complex networks at numbers that are significantly higher than those in randomized networks). Here, we proposed motif-based centrality measurements to identify keystone species. Both topological and dynamical approaches were employed to assess changes in ecosystem stability. After removing species according to various deletion sequences based on different motif centralities, secondary extinctions were recorded during sequential removals, and then robustness was calculated. We found that species with higher motif-based centrality (those who participated more food-web motifs) were more influential. It indicates that the motif-based centrality is an effective indicator for the identification of keystone species. Our findings emphasized the importance of motifs when detecting the role of a species in maintaining local biodiversity and provided a new aspect of environment management.},

abstract = {1. Most research on freshwater (and other) food webs has focused on apparently discrete communities, in well-defined habitats at small spatial and temporal scales, whereas in reality food webs are embedded in complex landscapes, such as river corridors. Food web linkages across such landscapes may be crucial for ecological pattern and process, however. Here, we consider the importance of large scale influences upon lotic food webs across the three spatial dimensions and through time. 2. We assess the roles of biotic factors (e.g. predation, competition) and physical habitat features (e.g. geology, land-use, habitat fragmentation) in moulding food web structure at the landscape scale. As examples, external subsidies to lotic communities of nutrients, detritus and prey vary along the river corridor, and food web links are made and broken across the land-water interface with the rise and fall of the flood. 3. We identify several avenues of potentially fruitful research, particularly the need to quantify energy flow and population dynamics. Stoichiometric analysis of changes in C: N: P nutrient ratios over large spatial gradients (e.g. from river source to mouth, in forested versus agricultural catchments), offers a novel method of uniting energy flow and population dynamics to provide a more holistic view of riverine food webs from a landscape perspective. Macroecological approaches can be used to examine large-scale patterns in riverine food webs (e.g. trophic rank and species-area relationships). New multivariate statistical techniques can be used to examine community responses to environmental gradients and to assign traits to individual species (e.g. body-size, functional feeding group), to unravel the organisation and trophic structure of riverine food webs.},

All children will learn about the setting in which the trip occurred, but only those in a moderately novel environ- ment will learn much about the intended lesson. In settings where novelty is either extremely great or small, imposed learning will be inhibited. Educators need to be aware of the effects of settings on learning in planning their lessons.

Reconciling these contrasting patterns is a key to advancing predictive theories of functional community ecology. We combined data on geographical distributions and three traits (wood density, leaf mass per area and maximumheight) of 173 tree species in Puerto Rico. We tested the hypothesis that species are more likely to occur where their trait values are more similar to the local CWM trait values (the ‘CWM-optimality' hypothesis) by comparing species occurrence patterns (as a proxy for fitness) with the functional composition of forest plots across a precipitation gradient. While 70{\%} of the species supported CWM-optimality for at least one trait, nearly 25{\%} significantly opposed it for at least one trait, thereby contributing to local functional diversity. The majority (85{\%}) of species that opposedCWMoptimality did so only for one trait and few species opposed CWM-optimality in multivariate trait space. Our study suggests that constraints to local functional variation act more strongly on multivariate phenotypes than on univariate traits.},

abstract = {Global biodiversity is affected by human pressure and climate change, and the present rate of biodiversity loss is probably higher than ever before. Community composition is also changing, and interspecific interactions are under severe pressure. The extinction of one species within a food web can result in further secondary extinctions, due to bottom-up effects that can be even more intense and less predictable than the direct effects of disturbance, undermining our capacity for ecosystem management and conservation. Here we investigated a metric for assessing the structural stability of food webs in the face of species loss, referred to as "Resistance", based on two fundamental web properties: (1) the proportion of key species in the web, a "key" species being one whose deletion leads to at least one secondary extinction, and (2) the mean number of secondary extinctions observed per key species deletion. We compared web Resistance with web Robustness (Dunne et al. 2002) based on 12 detritus-based riverine food webs under four species extinction scenarios on various temporal and spatial scales. We investigated the effect of multiple disturbances (extreme flood and river basin urbanization) on community vulnerability to biodiversity loss, assessing the behavior of Robustness and Resistance under the applied species extinction scenarios and testing their dependence on web topology. We estimated the contribution of the rarest and the most dominant species, and that of the most and least connected species, to web Resistance. Urbanization negatively affected community vulnerability to biodiversity loss. Only food web Resistance showed a significant flood effect and interaction between flood and urbanization. The most connected species contributed the most to food web resistance, whereas the rarest and the most abundant species had a similar, intermediate structural importance. Both food web Resistance and the role of selected key species varied across web description scales. Food web Resistance values were coherent across species extinction scenarios, demonstrating the suitability of the proposed approach for quantifying community vulnerability to species loss and the importance of considering food webs in monitoring and impact assessment programs. The approach is thus seen to be a promising research pathway supporting ecosystem management.},

abstract = {Species distributions have shifted in response to global warming in all major ecosystems on the Earth. Despite cogent evidence for these changes, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood and currently imply gradual shifts. Yet there is an increasing appreciation of the role of discrete events in driving ecological change. We show how a marine heat wave (HW) eliminated a prominent habitat-forming seaweed, Scytothalia dorycarpa, at its warm distribution limit, causing a range contraction of approximately 100 km (approx. 5{\%} of its global distribution). Seawater temperatures during the HW exceeded the seaweed's physiological threshold and caused extirpation of marginal populations, which are unlikely to recover owing to life-history traits and oceanographic processes. Scytothalia dorycarpa is an important canopy-forming seaweed in temperate Australia, and loss of the species at its range edge has caused structural changes at the community level and is likely to have ecosystem-level implications. We show that extreme warming events, which are increasing in magnitude and frequency, can force step-wise changes in species distributions in marine ecosystems. As such, return times of these events have major implications for projections of species distributions and ecosystem structure, which have typically been based on gradual warming trends. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract = {The fact that most female primates (and many other mammals) live in groups is paradoxical, given that the presence of others presumably increases competition for foods and may, for some, reduce reproductive success. Competition for food resources is generally inferred from any of the following observations: (1) female dominance hierarchies within groups; (2) female aggression between groups; (3) increasing home-range size with increasing group size; (4) longer day-range length with increasing group size; and (5) lower reproductive rates in larger groups. Both female aggression (interference competition) and adjustments of ranging behavior to group size (exploitative competition) have been linked in the past to patterns of food distribution and abundance. Using data largely from the literature, this paper examines the covariance of female aggression and ranging behavior among 20 species of primates in an attempt to better explain the variation in female relationships within and between groups of primates. Results show that groups of females are aggressive toward other groups and that home-range size increases with increasing group size in most species. In addition, in those species with strong dominance hierarchies within groups, day-range length increases as a function of group size. However, in those species that do not have strong dominance hierarchies within groups, day-range length does not increase as a function of group size. The implications of these results are presented in a model that suggests that intergroup competition is determined by food abundance, whereas intragroup competition is determined by food distribution. This model differs from earlier models in its explanation of the ecological conditions that influence female relationships within and between groups of primates.},

abstract = {Introduction The study of ecological networks with different types of interactions is still in its infancy. Most descriptors of network structure have been developed for networks with a single type of interaction, and mainly for unipartite networks such as food webs (Bersier et al., 2002). Similarly, our understanding of species coexistence and community stability derives from theoretical studies considering one interaction type, mostly competition or predation (Leibold, 1996; McCann et al., 1998). The study of networks with multiple interaction types faces many challenges: we need to define a typology of non-trophic interaction types (Olff et al., 2009; K{\'{e}}fi et al., 2012), collect new empirical data sampling simultaneously various interaction types (Pocock et al., 2012), develop network descriptors accounting for the diversity of interaction types (Fontaine et al., 2011; Sauve et al., 2016a), and build new theories to understand its implications on community and ecosystem functioning (K{\'{e}}fi et al., 2012; Mougi and Kondoh, 2012; Sanders et al., 2014). The purpose of this chapter is to present one possible framework to study the structure and dynamics of networks with a diversity of interaction types, exploring links between network structure and community stability. Interlinked Bipartite Webs: A Framework for Studying Networks with More Than One Interaction Type During the last decade, the study of bipartite networks – webs describing interactions between two given guilds in an ecosystem – has emerged as an important field of research in network ecology. Bipartite networks have been described for many different types of interactions: pollination (Memmott et al., 2004), seed dispersion (Jordano et al., 2003), herbivory (Cagnolo et al., 2011), predation (van Veen et al., 2008), parasitism (Vazquez et al., 2005), symbiosis (Montesinos-Navarro et al., 2012), and facilitation (Verd{\'{u}} and Valiente-Banuet, 2008). There is now an increasing knowledge of the structure and dynamics of these networks. In particular, we know that their structure and stability depend on the interaction type considered (Th{\'{e}}bault and Fontaine, 2010; Fontaine et al., 2011). On one hand, nestedness (network structure where specialist species interact with subsets of the species that interact with more generalist ones, Figure 5.1a) has often been described in mutualistic networks (Bascompte et al., 2003). On the other hand, antagonistic networks often appear more modular (i.e., they exhibit groups of species that interact more within groups than among groups, Figure 5.1b) than mutualistic webs (Fontaine et al., 2011; Krasnov et al., 2012).},

abstract = {Climate change would have profound influences on community structure and composition, and subsequently has impacts on ecosystem functioning and feedback to climate change. A field experiment with increased temperature and precipitation was conducted to examine effects of experimental warming, increased precipitation and their interactions on community structure and composition in a temperate steppe in northern China since April 2005. Increased precipitation significantly stimulated species richness and coverage of plant community. In contrast, experimental warming markedly reduced species richness of grasses and community coverage. Species richness was positively dependent upon soil moisture (SM) across all treatments and years. Redundancy analysis (RDA) illustrated that SM dominated the response of community composition to climate change at the individual level, suggesting indirect effects of climate change on plant community composition via altering water availability. In addition, species interaction also mediated the responses of functional group coverage to increased precipitation and temperature. Our observations revealed that both abiotic (soil water availability) and biotic (interspecific interactions) factors play important roles in regulating plant community structure and composition in response to climate change in the semiarid steppe. Therefore these factors should be incorporated in model predicting terrestrial vegetation dynamics under climate change. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Comparative research on food web structure has revealed generalities in trophic organization, produced simple models, and allowed assessment of robustness to species loss. These studies have mostly focused on free-living species. Recent research has suggested that inclusion of parasites alters structure. We assess whether such changes in network structure result from unique roles and traits of parasites or from changes to diversity and complexity. We analyzed seven highly resolved food webs that include metazoan parasite data. Our analyses show that adding parasites usually increases link density and connectance (simple measures of complexity), particularly when including concomitant links (links from predators to parasites of their prey). However, we clarify prior claims that parasites "dominate" food web links. Although parasites can be involved in a majority of links, in most cases classic predation links outnumber classic parasitism links. Regarding network structure, observed changes in degree distributions, 14 commonly studied metrics, and link probabilities are consistent with scale-dependent changes in structure associated with changes in diversity and complexity. Parasite and free-living species thus have similar effects on these aspects of structure. However, two changes point to unique roles of parasites. First, adding parasites and concomitant links strongly alters the frequency of most motifs of interactions among three taxa, reflecting parasites' roles as resources for predators of their hosts, driven by trophic intimacy with their hosts. Second, compared to free-living consumers, many parasites' feeding niches appear broader and less contiguous, which may reflect complex life cycles and small body sizes. This study provides new insights about generic versus unique impacts of parasites on food web structure, extends the generality of food web theory, gives a more rigorous framework for assessing the impact of any species on trophic organization, identifies limitations of current food web models, and provides direction for future structural and dynamical models.},

abstract = {Decreasing rate of migration in several species as a consequence of climate change and anthropic pressure, together with increasing evidence of space-use strategies intermediate between residency and complete migration, are very strong motivations to evaluate migration occurrence and features in animal populations. The main goal of this paper was to perform a relative comparison between methods for identifying and characterizing migration at the individual and population level on the basis of animal location data. We classified 104 yearly individual trajectories from five populations of three deer species as migratory or non-migratory, by means of three methods: seasonal home range overlap, spatio-temporal separation of seasonal clusters and the Net Squared Displacement (NSD) method. For migratory cases, we also measured timing and distance of migration and residence time on the summer range. Finally, we compared the classification in migration cases across methods and populations. All methods consistently identified migration at the population level, that is, they coherently distinguished between complete or almost complete migratory populations and partially migratory populations. However, in the latter case, methods coherently classified only about 50{\%} of the single cases, that is they classified differently at the individual-animal level. We therefore infer that the comparison of methods may help point to 'less-stereotyped' cases in the residency-to-migration continuum. For cases consistently classified by all methods, no significant differences were found in migration distance, or residence time on summer ranges. Timing of migration estimated by NSD was earlier than by the other two methods, both for spring and autumn migrations. We suggest three steps to identify improper inferences from migration data and to enhance understanding of intermediate space-use strategies. We recommend (i) classifying migration behaviours using more than one method, (ii) performing sensitivity analysis on method parameters to identify the extent of the differences and (iii) investigating inconsistently classified cases as these may often be ecologically interesting (i.e. less-stereotyped migratory behaviours).},

abstract = {To predict community-level responses to climate change, we must understand how variation in environmental conditions drives changes in an organism's ability to acquire resources and translate those resources into growth, reproduction, and survival. This challenge can be approached mechanistically by establishing linkages from biophysics to community ecology. For example, body temperature can be predicted from environmental conditions and species-specific morphological and behavioral traits. Variation in body temperature within and among species dictates physiological performance, rates of resource acquisition, and growth. These ecological characteristics, along with population size, define the strength with which species interact. Finally, the direct (individual level) and indirect (community level) effects of temperature jointly determine community structure. This mechanistic framework can complement correlational approaches to better predict ecological responses to climate change and identify which characteristics of a species or community act as leverage points for change. Research priorities for further development of the mechanistic approach include documentation and prediction of relevant spatial and temporal variation in body temperature and the relationships between body temperature, individual performance, and interspecific interactions.},

Here, we use current elevational range data for six taxonomic groups spanning 90° in latitude to examine the potential impacts of climate-driven range shifts on community change, or 'disassembly', across latitude. Elevational ranges are smaller at low latitudes for most groups and, as a consequence, tropical communities appear to be more sensitive to temperature increases compared with temperate communities. Under site-specific temperature projections, we generally found greater community disassembly in tropical compared with temperate communities, although this varied by dispersal assumptions. Mountain height can impact the amount of community disassembly, with greater change occurring on smaller mountains. Finally, projected community disassembly was higher for ectotherms than endotherms, although the variation among ectotherms was greater than the variation separating endotherms and ectotherms. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

We apply the method to linear models for periodic environments (including seasonal harvest models), to vec-permutation models in which individuals are classified by multiple criteria, and to nonlinear models including both immediate and delayed density dependence.

The information contained in such interac-tion matrices depends on the sampling design, and typically, compounds preferences (specialization) and abundances (activity). Null models are the primary vehicles to disentangle the effects of specialization from those of sampling and abundance, but they ignore the feedback of network structure on abundances. Hence, network structure, as exemplified here by modu-larity, is difficult to link to specific causes. Indeed, various processes lead to modularity and to specific interaction patterns more generally. Inferring (co)evolutionary dynamics is even more challenging, as competition and trait matching yield identical patterns of interactions. A satisfactory resolution of the underlying factors determining network structure will require substan-tial additional information, not only on independently assessed abundances, but also on traits, and ideally on fitness consequences as measured in exper-imental setups.},

abstract = {Complementary resource use and redundancy of species that fulfill the
same ecological role are two mechanisms that can respectively increase
and stabilize process rates in ecosystems. For example, predator
complementarity and redundancy can determine prey consumption rates and
their stability, yet few studies take into account the multiple predator
species Attacking multiple prey at different rates in natural
communities. Thus, it remains unclear whether these biodiversity
mechanisms are important determinants of consumption in entire predator
prey assemblages, such that food-web interaction structure determines
community-wide consumption and stability.
Here, we use empirical quantitative food webs to study the
community-wide effects of functional complementarity and redundancy of
consumers (parasitoids) on herbivore control in temperate forests. We
find that complementarity in host resource use by parasitoids was a
strong predictor of absolute parasitism rates at the community level and
that redundancy in host-use patterns stabilized community-wide
parasitism rates in space, but not through time. These effects can
potentially explain previous contradictory results from predator
diversity research. Phylogenetic diversity (measured using taxonomic
distance) did not explain functional complementarity or parasitism
rates, so could not serve as a surrogate measure for functional
complementarity.
Our study shows that known mechanisms underpinning predator diversity
effects on both functioning and stability can easily be extended to link
food webs to ecosystem functioning.},

Here we examine published data on 2798 elevational range shifts from 43 study sites to assess the confounding effect of land-use change on climate-driven species redistribution. We show that baseline forest cover and recent forest cover change are critical predictors in determining the magnitude of elevational range shifts. Forest loss positively interacts with baseline temperature conditions, such that forest loss in warmer regions tends to accelerate species' upslope movement. Consequently, not only climate but also habitat loss stressors and, importantly, their synergistic effects matter in forecasting species elevational redistribution, especially in the tropics where both stressors will increase the risk of net lowland biotic attrition.},

Although the importance of habitat networks for individual species is clear, their significance for long-term ecological resilience and multi-species conservation strategies is less established. Referencing spatial network theory, we describe the conceptual basis for defining and assessing a network of wildlife areas that supports species' resilience to multiple forms of perturbations and pressures. We explore actions that could enhance network resilience at a range of scales, based on ecological principles, with reference to four well-established strategies for intervention in a spatial network (“Better, Bigger, More and Joined”) from the influential Making Space for Nature report by Lawton et al. (). Building existing theory into useable and scalable approaches applicable to large numbers of species is challenging but tractable. We illustrate the policy context, describe the elements of a long-term adaptive management plan and provide example actions, metrics and targets for early implementation using England as a case study, where there is an opportunity to include large-scale ecological planning in a newly launched 25-year environment plan. Policy implications. The concept of resilient ecological networks has attracted scientific and political support, but there is no consensus on what a resilient network would look like, or how to assess it. Therefore, it is unclear whether existing targets for action will be sufficient to achieve network resilience. We show that the scientific principles to place resilience and network theory at the heart of large-scale and long-term environmental planning are established and ready to implement in practice. Delivering a resilient network to support nature recovery is achievable and can be integrated with ongoing conservation actions and targets, by assessing their effectiveness on properties of the entire network. England's 25 Year Environment Plan promises to deliver a natural environment that is protected and enhanced for the future and so provides the ideal testbed.},

abstract = {Species are largely predicted to shift poleward as global temperatures increase, with this fingerprint of climate change being already observed across a range of taxonomic groups and, mostly temperate, geographic locations 1-5. However, the assumption of uni-directional distribution shifts does not account for complex interactions among temperature, precipitation and species-specific tolerances6, all of which shape the direction and magnitude of changes in a species' climatic niche. We analysed 60 years of past climate change on the Australian continent, assessing the velocity of changes in temperature and precipitation, as well as changes in climatic niche space for 464 Australian birds. We show large magnitude and rapid rates of change in Australian climate over the past 60 years resulting in high-velocity and multi-directional, including equatorial, shifts in suitable climatic space for birds (ranging from 0.1 to 7.6 km yr-1, mean 1.27 km yr -1). Overall, if measured only in terms of poleward distribution shifts, the fingerprint of climate change is underestimated by an average of 26{\%} in temperate regions of the continent and by an average of 95{\%} in tropical regions. We suggest that the velocity of movement required by Australian species to track their climatic niche may be much faster than previously thought and that the interaction between temperature and precipitation changes will result in multi-directional distribution shifts globally.

abstract = {Habitat isolation is well known to alter patterns of species' abundance, richness, and the ratios of predators : prey. Less clear, however, is how isolation alters interactions within food webs. Here, we present the results from an experiment performed in artificial ponds (mesocosms) manipulating habitat isolation crossed with a predator reduction treatment to disentangle how isolation mediates the top-down effect of predators. The strength of the trophic cascade, from predators, through herbivores, to producers, was considerably stronger in connected than in isolated habitats. We further found that the overall richness of both predator and herbivore species declined strongly with isolation. Experimental predator reductions suggest that the mechanism underlying the herbivore response was likely mediated by a keystone predator effect; when predators were reduced, herbivore richness was lower, and there was no discernable effect of isolation on herbivore richness. Finally, we found that the composition of predators in more isolated habitats consisted of species that were smaller and likely less effective predators than species that persisted in less isolated habitats. In all, our experiment showed that habitat isolation can alter the structure of communities by a combination of direct effects of the species in question, as well as effects mediated through their interactions in the food web.},

abstract = {We review empirical studies on how bioinvasions alter food webs and how a food-web perspective may change their prediction and management. Predation is found to underlie the most spectacular damage in invaded systems, sometimes cascading down to primary producers. Indirect trophic effects (exploitative and apparent competition) also affect native species, but rarely provoke extinctions, while invaders often have positive bottom-up effects on higher trophic levels. As a result of these trophic interactions, and of nontrophic ones such as mutualisms or ecosystem engineering, invasions can profoundly modify the structure of the entire food web. While few studies have been undertaken at this scale, those that have highlight how network properties such as species richness, phenotypic diversity, and functional diversity, limit the likelihood and impacts of invasions by saturating niche space. Vulnerable communities have unsaturated niche space mainly because of evolutionary history in isolation (islands), dispersal limitation, or anthropogenic disturbance. Evolution also modulates the insertion of invaders into a food web. Exotics and natives are evolutionarily new to one another, and invasion tends to retain alien species that happen to have advantage over residents in trophic interactions. Resident species, therefore, often rapidly evolve traits to better tolerate or exploit invaders—a process that may eventually restore more balanced food webs and prevent extinctions. We discuss how network-based principles might guide management policies to better live with invaders, rather than to undertake the daunting (and often illusory) task of eradicating them one by one.},

The main objectives of this study were to analyze the relative importance of different types of salt pond (industrial, traditional and inactive) to shorebirds throughout the tidal cycle, as well as determine the environmental factors that affect the use of salt ponds by shorebirds. Birds were counted during low and high tides on salt ponds in the Guadiana estuary, southeast Portugal. Simultaneously, the environmental conditions of each of the 212 pans studied were recorded and their importance analyzed using logistic regression models. Although more birds used the salt ponds during the high-tide, many species stayed in the study area during lowtide, suggesting a preference to feed on salt ponds as compared to tidal flats. Industrial salt ponds were preferred by most of the species. Water depth, salinity and area were major factors in explaining the presence of the shorebirds and, hence, are the most important environmental variables to take into consideration when devising management plans for salt ponds.},

abstract = {Matrix projection models are among the most widely used tools in plant ecology. However, the way in which plant ecologists use and interpret these models differs from the way in which they are presented in the broader academic literature. In contrast to calls from earlier reviews, most studies of plant populations are based on {\textless}5 matrices and present simple metrics such as deterministic population growth rates. However, plant ecologists also cautioned against literal interpretation of model predictions. Although academic studies have emphasized testing quantitative model predictions, such forecasts are not the way in which plant ecologists find matrix models to be most useful. Improving forecasting ability would necessitate increased model complexity and longer studies. Therefore, in addition to longer term studies with better links to environmental drivers, priorities for research include critically evaluating relative/comparative uses of matrix models and asking how we can use many short-term studies to understand long-term population dynamics.},
annote = {ABSTRACT
Plant ecologists use matrixes in many different ways, mostly with 5 or less matrixes and to forecast simple effects like population growth. They know that they are not enough to have a reliable forecast. To have a better understanding of the future we need to understand better how to link short studies to long studies and create long term studies to comprehende the drivers that we at the moment don't consider in our matrix population models. 

INTRODUCTION
Managment should use more matrix population models.
They evaluated how the matrixes has been used and which one are the strengths and weaknesses of the models.

REVIEW OF MATRIX MODELS
They reviewed 400 papers.
Uses of matrix models
Matrix models are used for both basic research and managment research. More and more for managment in the last years. The basic research is mainly focus on understanding life history traits and population ecology.
Managment studies focused mainly on invasive species, at risk species and harversted species. In the last period of time the invasive species and at risk species studies increased. How the matrixes were used to study these kind of populations differed along papers.
Spatial and temporal extent of data in matrix models
?
PREDICTIONS FROM MATRIX MODELS
There have been also studies that focused on other parameters, but almost all of them focused on population growth, how a change in the life traits would affect population growth and extinction risk.
Population growth rates
In the past literature most of the studies calculated only a deterministic population growth rate. Even if the number of studies that calculated a stochastic population growth rate increased, still is not so high and they use 5 or less matrixes.
Most of the studies were density indepent. This could be because density is not relevant as other paramesters like interspecific competition or environmental factor.
Despite the fact that plants population vary their life traits among the years, most of the studies are deterministic. Maybe it's because this kind of studies perform better with small amounts of data.
Sensitivity analyses
Matrix models have been used to understand how lambda will change in the future, why lambda is like this in the present. Life table response experiments have been used only by a few people.
However, in the past years perturbation analysis have been used more and more, especially LTRE - even if sometimes in a wrong way, like trying to predict the changes in a population in the future basing predictions upon small changes happend to it in the past. 
Extinction risk
Was calculated mainly in population at risk for managment purposes. 
Some researchers calculated the ratio of years at which is possible to calculate the extinction risk. It's hard to predict extinctions rate in plants if they unobservable life stages. In addition, there's no way of knowing other factors like land use and so on. 
INTERPRETATION OF MODEL PREDICTIONS
Some people think that population matrix models are a good tool to predict the future of a population and someones don't. 
Half of the papers caveats the reader from reading the results literally. 
Every researcher agreed that MPM are useful to guide conservation. Not everyone agreed wheter this models are useful for decide which managment option should be chosen, if a population is growing or degrowing and its extinction risk. 

CONCLUDING REMARKS
They are good models because are better than subjective managment analysis and because they can emphasize how some of the stages should be protected more than others. 
Sometimes researchers interprete the MPM in a literal way, not even using the most sophisticated tools. 
To estimate the real population growth in the future will be needed to predict natural stochasticity due to changes in the environment. 
FUTURE:
Better studyings, studying of the environmental stochasticity and more data (more years). Short studies could be used to understand how the populations will perform in the future. We need to understand how to interpret the short studies in a useful way. 

A review of papers that used them to study animals would be useful.},

abstract = {Efforts to characterize food webs have generated two influential approaches that reduce the complexity of natural communities. The traditional approach groups individuals based on their species identity, while recently developed approaches group individuals based on their body size. While each approach has provided important insights, they have largely been used in parallel in different systems. Consequently, it remains unclear howbody size and species identity interact, hampering our ability to develop a more holistic framework that integrates both approaches.We address this conceptual gap by developing a framework which describes how both approaches are related to each other, revealing that both approaches share common but untested assumptions about how variation across size classes or species influences differences in ecological interactions among consumers. Using freshwater mesocosms with dragonfly larvae as predators, we then experimentally demonstrate that while body size strongly determined how predators affected communities, these size effects were species specific and frequently nonlinear, violating a key assumption underlying both size- and species-based approaches. Consequently, neither purely species- nor size-based approaches were adequate to predict functional differences among predators. Instead, functional differences emerged from the synergistic effects of body size and species identity. This clearly demonstrates the need to integrate size- and species-based approaches to predict functional diversity within communities. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

abstract = {With recent predictions for global climate warming, the question arises as to how changes in temperature influence the dynamics of populations in natural communities. We investigated the effect of temperature (18 and 25°C) on the stability of a common freshwater predator-prey system consisting of Daphnia pulex and phytoplankton in different types of mesocosm communities. The plant-herbivore dynamics were examined in the presence and absence of the predator Mesostoma ehrenbergii to simulate food chains of two or three trophic levels, and in the presence or absence of competing zooplankton. The predator-prey system was destabilized at the higher temperature in all types of communities, and D. pulex extinction always occurred. This result was unaffected by simplification of the community but was enhanced by the addition of the carnivore. Mechanisms are proposed for the observed results including (i) the direct effect of temperature on vital rate parameters describing the D. pulex-algal interaction and (ii) a shift in algal community structure to less edible species following suppression by the herbivore at the higher temperature. Some implications of temperature increases expected under current global warming scenarios in pond systems are discussed.},

While prior publications have tackled the topics of estimating and interpreting such networks, little work has been conducted to check how accurate (i.e., prone to sampling variation) networks are estimated, and how stable (i.e., interpretation remains similar with less observations) inferences from the network structure (such as centrality indices) are. In this tutorial paper, we aim to introduce the reader to this field and tackle the problem of accuracy under sampling variation. We first introduce the current state-of-the-art of network estimation. Second, we provide a rationale why researchers should investigate the accuracy of psychological networks. Third, we describe how bootstrap routines can be used to (A) assess the accuracy of estimated network connections, (B) investigate the stability of centrality indices, and (C) test whether network connections and centrality estimates for different variables differ from each other. We introduce two novel statistical methods: for (B) the correlation stability coefficient, and for (C) the bootstrapped difference test for edge-weights and centrality indices. We conducted and present simulation studies to assess the performance of both methods. Finally, we developed the free R-package bootnet that allows for estimating psychological networks in a generalized framework in addition to the proposed bootstrap methods. We showcase bootnet in a tutorial, accompanied by R syntax, in which we analyze a dataset of 359 women with posttraumatic stress disorder available online.},

abstract = {Climatic effects in the ocean at the community level are poorly described, yet accurate predictions about ecosystem responses to changing environmental conditions rely on understanding biotic responses in a food-web context to support knowledge about direct biotic responses to the physical environment. Here we conduct time-series analyses with multivariate autoregressive (MAR) models of marine zooplankton abundance in the Northern California Current from 1996 to 2009 to determine the influence of climate variables on zooplankton community interactions. Autoregressive models showed different community interactions during warm vs. cool ocean climate conditions. Negative ecological interactions among zooplankton groups characterized the major warm phase during the time series, whereas during the major cool phase, ocean transport largely structured zooplankton communities. Local environmental conditions (sea temperature) and large-scale climate indices (El Ni{\~{n}}o/Southern Oscillation) were associated with changes in zooplankton abundance across the full time series. Secondary environmental correlates of zooplankton abundance varied with ocean climate phase, with most support during the warm phase for upwelling as a covariate, and most support during the cool phase for salinity. Through simultaneous quantitation of community interactions and environmental covariates, we show that marine zooplankton community structure varies with climate, suggesting that predictions about ecosystem responses to future climate scenarios in the Northern California Current should include potential changes to the base of the pelagic food. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {Global conversion of natural habitats to agriculture has led to marked changes in species diversity and composition. However, it is less clear how habitat modification affects interactions among species. Networks of feeding interactions (food webs) describe the underlying structure of ecological communities, and might be crucially linked to their stability and function. Here, we analyse 48 quantitative food webs for cavity-nesting bees, wasps and their parasitoids across five tropical habitat types. We found marked changes in food-web structure across the modification gradient, despite little variation in species richness. The evenness of interaction frequencies declined with habitat modification, with most energy flowing along one or a few pathways in intensively managed agricultural habitats. In modified habitats there was a higher ratio of parasitoid to host species and increased parasitism rates, with implications for the important ecosystem services, such as pollination and biological control, that are performed by host bees and wasps. The most abundant parasitoid species was more specialized in modified habitats, with reduced attack rates on alternative hosts. Conventional community descriptors failed to discriminate adequately among habitats, indicating that perturbation of the structure and function of ecological communities might be overlooked in studies that do not document and quantify species interactions. Altered interaction structure therefore represents an insidious and functionally important hidden effect of habitat modification by humans. {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Because it is so difficult to monitor and manage every aspect of biodiversity, several shortcuts have been proposed whereby we monitor and/or protect single species. The indicator species concept is problematic because there is no consensus on what the indicator is supposed to indicate and because it is difficult to know which is the best indicator species even when we agree on what it should indicate. The umbrella species (a species that needs such large tracts of habitat that saving it will automatically save many other species) seems like a better approach, although often whether many other species will really fall under the umbrella is a matter of faith rather than research. Intensive management of an indicator or an umbrella species (for example, by transplant or supplemental feeding) is a contradiction in terms because the rest of the community to be indicated or protected does not receive such treatment. A flagship species, normally a charismatic large vertebrate, is one that can be used to anchor a conservation campaign because it arouses public interest and sympathy, but a flagship need not be a good indicator or umbrella. And conservation of flagship species is often very expensive. Further, management regimes of two flagship species can conflict. Ecosystem management, often on a landscape scale, is a proposed solution to problems of single-species management. Keep the ecosystem healthy, according to this view, and component species will all thrive. However, conservationists have concerns about ecosystem management. First, it is variously defined, and many definitions emphasize the commodities ecosystems provide for humans rather than how humans can protect ecosystems. Second, the term 'ecosystem health' is ill-defined and associated with an out-moded, superorganismic view of the ecosystem. Third, ecosystem management seems focused on processes and so would appear to permit losses of species so long as they did not greatly affect processes like nutrient-cycling. Fourth, ecosystem management is often implemented by adaptive management. This may make it difficult to study the underlying mechanisms driving an ecosystem and to know when an entirely new management approach is needed. Thus, some conservationists see ecosystem management as a Trojan horse that would allow continued environmental destruction in the name of modern resource management. The recognition that some ecosystems have keystone species whose activities govern the well-being of many other species suggests an approach that may unite the best features of single-species and ecosystem management. If we can identify keystone species and the mechanisms that cause them to have such wide-ranging impacts, we would almost certainly derive information on the functioning of the entire ecosystem that would be useful in its management. Some keystone species themselves may be appropriate targets for management, but, even when they are not, our understanding of the ecosystem will be greatly increased. Keystone species may not be a panacea, however. We do not yet know how many ecosystems have keystone species, and the experiments that lead to their identification are often very difficult.},

We measured key characteristics of all tree species in which agile gibbons slept, including exposure of the tree crown, root system, height, species and presence of food. Gibbons most frequently slept in Dipterocarpaceae and Fabaceae trees and preferentially chose trees taller than average, slept above the mean canopy height and showed a preference for liana-free trees. These choices could reflect avoidance of competition with other frugivores, but we argue these choices reflect gibbons prioritizing avoidance of predation. The results highlight that gibbons are actively selecting and rejecting sleeping trees based on several characteristics. The importance of the presence of large trees for food is noted and provides insight into gibbon antipredatory behaviour.},

abstract = {The aim of our study was to characterize the factors that shape the pattern of change in ant species richness and community structure along altitudinal gradients in two valleys located on the northern and southern side of the Pyrenees. During three summers, we sampled 20 sites distributed across two Pyrenean valleys ranging in elevation from 1,009 to 2,339 m using pitfall traps and hand collection. We employed diversity index, degree of nestedness of ant assemblages, ordination method, and multiple regression analysis to examine the effects of various environmental factors on ant species communities. In total, 41 ant species were found in the two valleys. The number of species was 26 {\%} lower in the valley located on the northern side than in that located on the southern side. At the valley scale, the number of ant species, as well as the evenness, decreased with elevation. A significant nested pattern was observed, indicating that the species found in the poorest site represented a subset of those found at the richest one. Ants collected at mid- and high-elevation sites had a wider altitudinal range than those collected at low-elevation sites, thus complying with Rapoport's rule. Our results suggest that, although elevation strongly influences the organization of ant communities, ecological factors such as temperature and local habitat features (sun exposure, vegetation density) are the main factors explaining the pattern of ant diversity along altitudinal gradients.},

abstract = {Climate warming is predicted to alter the structure, stability, and
functioning of food webs(1-5). Yet, despite the importance of soil food
webs for energy and nutrient turnover in terrestrial ecosystems, the
effects of warming on these food webs-particularly in combination with
other global change drivers-are largely unknown. Here, we present
results from two complementary field experiments that test the
interactive effects of warming with forest canopy disturbance and
drought on energy flux in boreal-temperate ecotonal forest soil food
webs. The first experiment applied a simultaneous above-and belowground
warming treatment (ambient, +1.7 degrees C, +3.4 degrees C) to
closed-canopy and recently clear-cut forest, simulating common forest
disturbance(6). The second experiment crossed warming with a summer
drought treatment (-40{\%} rainfall) in the clear-cut habitats. We show
that warming reduces energy flux to microbes, while forest canopy
disturbance and drought facilitates warming-induced increases in energy
flux to higher trophic levels and exacerbates the reduction in energy
flux to microbes, respectively. Contrary to expectations, we find no
change in whole-network resilience to perturbations, but significant
losses in ecosystem functioning. Warming thus interacts with forest
disturbance and drought, shaping the energetic structure of soil food
webs and threatening the provisioning of multiple ecosystem functions in
boreal-temperate ecotonal forests.},

abstract = {Global warming can affect all levels of biological complexity, though we currently understand least about its potential impact on communities and ecosystems. At the ecosystem level, warming has the capacity to alter the structure of communities and the rates of key ecosystem processes they mediate. Here we assessed the effects of a 4°C rise in temperature on the size structure and taxonomic composition of benthic communities in aquatic mesocosms, and the rates of detrital decomposition they mediated. Warming had no effect on biodiversity, but altered community size structure in two ways. In spring, warmer systems exhibited steeper size spectra driven by declines in total community biomass and the proportion of large organisms. By contrast, in autumn, warmer systems had shallower size spectra driven by elevated total community biomass and a greater proportion of large organisms. Community-level shifts were mirrored by changes in decomposition rates. Temperature-corrected microbial and macrofaunal decomposition rates reflected the shifts in community structure and were strongly correlated with biomass across mesocosms. Our study demonstrates that the 4°C rise in temperature expected by the end of the century has the potential to alter the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems profoundly, as well as the intimate linkages between these levels of ecological organization. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Plant introductions and subsequent community shifts are known to affect nutrient cycling, but most such studies have focused on nutrient enrichment effects. The nature of plant-driven nutrient depletions and the mechanisms by which these might occur are relatively poorly understood. In this study we demonstrate that the proliferation of the commonly introduced coconut palm, Cocos nucifera, interrupts the flow of allochthonous marine subsidies to terrestrial ecosystems via an indirect effect: impact on birds. Birds avoid nesting or roosting in C. nucifera, thus reducing the critical nutrient inputs they bring from the marine environment. These decreases in marine subsidies then lead to reductions in available soil nutrients, decreases in leaf nutrient quality, diminished leaf palatability, and reduced herbivory. This nutrient depletion pathway contrasts the more typical patterns of nutrient enrichment that follow plant species introductions. Research on the effects of spatial subsidy disruptions on ecosystems has not yet examined interruptions driven by changes within the recipient community, such as plant community shifts. The ubiquity of coconut palm introductions across the tropics and subtropics makes these observations particularly noteworthy. Equally important, the case of C. nucifera provides a strong demonstration of how plant community changes can dramatically impact the supply of allochthonous nutrients and thereby reshape energy flow in ecosystems.},

Seven countries form the core of the IFTN, with high values of betweenness centrality and each trading with over 77{\%} of all the countries in the world.

abstract = {Ecological networks depict the interactions between species, mainly based on observations in the field. The information contained in such interaction matrices depends on the sampling design, and typically, compounds preferences (specialization) and abundances (activity). Null models are the primary vehicles to disentangle the effects of specialization from those of sampling and abundance, but they ignore the feedback of network structure on abundances. Hence, network structure, as exemplified here by modularity, is difficult to link to specific causes. Indeed, various processes lead to modularity and to specific interaction patterns more generally. Inferring (co)evolutionary dynamics is even more challenging, as competition and trait matching yield identical patterns of interactions. A satisfactory resolution of the underlying factors determining network structure will require substantial additional information, not only on independently assessed abundances, but also on traits, and ideally on fitness consequences as measured in experimental setups.},

abstract = {1. We established complex marine communities, consisting of over 100 species, in large subtidal experimental mesocosms. We measured the strength of direct interactions and the net strength of direct and indirect interactions between the species in those communities, using a combination of theoretical and empirical approaches. 2. Theoretical predictions of interaction strength were derived from the interaction coefficient matrix, which was parameterised using allometric predator-prey relationships. Empirical estimates of interaction strength were quantified using the ln-ratio, which measures the change in biomass density of species A in the presence and absence of species B. 3. We observed that highly connected species tend to have weak direct effects and net effects in our experimental food webs, whether we calculate interaction strength theoretically or empirically. 4. We found a significant correlation between our theoretical predictions and empirical estimates of direct effects and net effects. The net effects correlation was much stronger, indicating that our experimental communities were dominated by a mixture of direct and indirect effects. 5. Re-calculation of the theoretical predictions of net effects after randomising predator and prey body masses did not affect the negative relationship with connectance. 6. These results suggest that food web topology, which in this system is constrained by body mass, is overwhelmingly important for the magnitude of direct and indirect interactions and hence species importance in the face of biodiversity declines. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

To do so, ecologists are widely using phenomenological models of species distributions that mainly rely on the concept of species niche and generally ignore species' demography, species' adaptive potential, and biotic interactions. This review examines the potential role of the emerging synthetic discipline of evolutionary community ecology in improving our understanding of how climate change will alter future distribution of biodiversity. We review theoretical and empirical advances about the role of niche evolution, interspecific interactions, and their interplay in altering species geographic ranges and community assembly. We discuss potential ways to integrate complex feedbacks between ecology and evolution in ecological forecasting. We also point at a number of caveats in our understanding of the eco-evolutionary consequences of climate change and highlight several challenges for future research.

abstract = {Among the most popular of metrics used to quantify landscape composition are Shannon's index, believed to emphasize the richness component of diversity, and Simpson's index, emphasizing the evenness component. These indices can show considerable variation in response to changes in landscape richness and evenness. However, the possibility of encountering opposite trends in the responses of these indices to assemblages that differ in only a single component of diversity has not been sufficiently acknowledged. An opposite response of these indices was observed for two Indian landscapes with the same richness, differing only in evenness. Using a numerical simulation, the likelihood of encountering landscapes with an opposite response was demonstrated to increase with increasing richness, from about 4{\%} for landscapes consisting of three cover types, to about 6{\%} for ten types. This emphasizes the need for caution when choosing an index of landscape diversity. Rare cover types provide habitats for sensitive species and facilitate critical ecological processes. The Shannon index, sensitive to their presence, is therefore recommended for landscape management within an ecological framework. Simpson's index, more responsive to the dominant cover type, can be used for specific situations where the dominant cover type is of interest, such as single-species reserve design. },

abstract = {While it is well established that ecosystem subsidies-the addition of energy, nutrients, or materials across ecosystem boundaries-can affect consumer abundance, there is less information available on how subsidy levels may affect consumer diet, body condition, trophic position, and resource partitioning among consumer species. There is also little information on whether changes in vegetation structure commonly associated with spatial variation in subsidies may play an important role in driving consumer responses to subsidies. To address these knowledge gaps, we studied changes in abundance, diet, trophic position, size, and body condition of two congeneric gecko species (Lepidodactylus spp.) that coexist in palm dominated and native (hereafter dicot dominated) forests across the Central Pacific. These forests differ strongly both in the amount of marine subsidies that they receive from seabird guano and carcasses, and in the physical structure of the habitat. Contrary to other studies, we found that subsidy level had no impact on the abundance of either gecko species; it also did not have any apparent effects on resource partitioning between species. However, it did affect body size, dietary composition, and trophic position of both species. Geckos in subsidized, dicot forests were larger, had higher body condition and more diverse diets, and occupied a much higher trophic position than geckos found in palm dominated, low subsidy level forests. Both direct variation in subsidy levels and associated changes in habitat structure appear to play a role in driving these responses. These results suggest that variation in subsidy levels may drive important behavioral responses in predators, even when their numerical response is limited. Strong changes in trophic position of consumers also suggest that subsidies may drive increasingly complex food webs, with longer overall food chain length.},

abstract = {Biodiversity assessment requires that we use surrogate information in practice to indicate more general biodiversity patterns. ‘ED' refers to a surrogates framework that can link species data and environmental information based on a robust relationship of compositional dissimilarities to ordinations that indicate underlying environmental variation. In an example analysis of species and environmental data from Panama, the environmental and spatial variables that correlate with an hybrid multi-dimensional scaling ordination were able to explain 83{\%} of the variation in the corresponding Bray Curtis dissimilarities. The assumptions of ED also provide the rationale for its use of p-median optimization criteria to measure biodiversity patterns among sites in a region. M.B. Arau´ jo, P.J. Densham {\&} P.H. Williams (2004, Journal of Biogeography 31, 1) have re-named ED as ‘AD' in their evaluation of the surrogacy value of ED based on European species data. Because lessons from previous work on ED options consequently may have been neglected, we use a corroboration framework to investigate the evidence and ‘background knowledge' presented in their evaluations of ED. Investigations focus on the possibility that their weak corroboration of ED surrogacy (nonsignificance of target species recovery relative to a null model) may be a consequence of Arau´ jo et al.'s use of particular evidence and randomizations. We illustrate how their use of discrete ED, and not the recommended continuous ED, may have produced unnecessarily poor species recovery values. Further, possible poor optimization of their MDS ordinations, due to small numbers of simulations and/or low resolution of stress values appears to have provided a possible poor basis for ED application and, consequently, may have unnecessarily favoured non-corroboration results. Consideration of Arau´ jo et al.'s randomizations suggests that acknowledged sampling biases in the European data have not only artefactually promoted the non-significance of ED recovery values, but also artefactually elevated the significance of competing species surrogates recovery values.We conclude that little credence should be given to the comparisons of ED and species-based complementarity sets presented in M.B. Arau´ jo, P.J. Densham {\&} P.H. Williams (2004, Journal of Biogeography 31, 1), unless the factors outlined here can be analysed for their effects on results. We discuss the lessons concerning surrogates evaluation emerging from our investigations, calling for better provision in such studies of the background information that can allow (i) critical examination of evidence (both at the initial corroboration and re-evaluation stages), and (ii) greater synthesis of lessons about the pitfalls of different forms of evidence in different contexts.},

abstract = {The carbon cycle modulates climate change via the regulation of atmospheric CO2, and represents one of the most important ecosystem services of value to humans. However, considerable uncertainties remain concerning potential feedbacks between the biota and the climate. We developed theoretical models derived from the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE), and tested them in an ecosystem-level manipulative experiment in freshwater mesocosms. The year-long experiment simulated a warming scenario (A1B; [IPCC, 2007]) expected by the end of the century. The key components of the carbon cycle - that is gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER) and CH4 efflux (ME) - measured in our experiment were all strongly related to temperature. Their temperature dependence was typically constrained by the average activation energy of their particular metabolic pathway, and as predicted by our models, this increased progressively for GPP, ER and ME. Warming of 4 C decreased the sequestration of CO2 by 13{\%}, increased the fraction of primary production effluxing as methane by 20{\%} and the fraction of ER as methane by 9{\%}, in line with the offset in their respective activation energies. Because methane has 21 times the greenhouse gas radiative potential of CO2, these results suggest aquatic ecosystems could drive a previously unknown positive feedback between warming and the carbon cycle. We then used a series of global data compilations of measurements of rates of primary production and respiration to better understand the temperature dependence of the carbon cycle in other aquatic ecosystems and to compare them with data from terrestrial systems. Our experimental results were mirrored by our global data compilations, with the effective activation energy for marine and freshwater primary production identical to GPP measured in our experiment. Similarly, the temperature dependences of respiration in estuaries, lakes and the ocean were indistinguishable from that of ER in our experiment. Finally, our study suggests that the temperature dependence of primary production and respiration in aquatic ecosystems might differ from those in terrestrial ecosystems, and this could be crucial in predicting the future response of the carbon cycle in these different systems to global warming. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Forested tropical peatlands in Southeast Asia are important as global carbon stores and for biodiversity conservation yet are being rapidly converted to agriculture or degraded into fire-prone non-forest vegetation. Although large areas have been abandoned, there is little evidence for the subsequent recovery of forest. As part of a study of forest degradation and recovery, we assessed seed rain into an area of non-forest regrowth in degraded tropical peatland in the former Mega Rice Project: an abandoned attempt to convert 1 million hectares of tropical peatland for rice production in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Fifty seed traps were placed in the open and fifty under trees. Seeds were collected every 15±3days for 1year. Seed rain and foreign seed rain (species different from the tree over the trap) was higher for traps under trees (1127.8 seeds and 465.0 seedsm-2y-1 respectively) than for traps in the open (95.2 seedsm-2y-1). Foreign seed rain consisted largely of species that also grow in mature forest, but was dominated by a few abundant wind-dispersed species (particularly from the woody liana, Uncaria elliptica, and the tree, Combretocarpus rotundatus) and the majority of animal-dispersed foreign seeds were found under trees. While seed rain both in the open and under trees appears sufficient for the development of woody plant cover, diversity will be limited in the early stages of succession. We recommend enrichment planting with species that would have been present before forest destruction but are not represented in the current seed rain. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Recent developments in neuroscience have emphasised the importance of integrated distributed networks of brain areas for successful cognitive functioning. Our current understanding is that the brain has a modular organisation in which segregated networks supporting specialised processing are linked through a few long-range connections, ensuring processing integration. Although such architecture is structurally stable, it appears to be flexible in its functioning, enabling long-range connections to regulate the information flow and facilitate communication among the relevant modules, depending on the contingent cognitive demands. Here we show how insights brought by the coregistration of transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroencephalography (TMS-EEG) integrate and support recent models of functional brain architecture. Moreover, we will highlight the types of data that can be obtained through TMS-EEG, such as the timing of signal propagation, the excitatory/inhibitory nature of connections and causality. Last, we will discuss recent emerging applications of TMS-EEG in the study of brain disorders.},

abstract = {In the context of present global changes, interest in understanding how systems respond to anthropogenic environmental pressures and stress has increased. Indices that characterize ecosystem state are helpful tools for the interpretation of ecosystem responses. The central question is how to link these responses to ecosystem structure and functioning and to quantify ecosystem persistence, resistance or resilience. Quantification and characterization of trophic networks by ecological network analysis (ENA) indices is proceeding rapidly, especially in the field of coastal ecology. In this contribution, we review several theories that relate ecosystem structure and function to stability. The structure and functioning of ecosystems change during the maturation of ecosystems. In the first section, the maturation of ecosystems is described using thermodynamics. In the second and third parts of this paper, we define some concepts for analysing structure and functioning of food webs and discuss their relation to stability. In the last section, we describe three ENA indices and their link to stability. We demonstrate that ENA provides powerful tools for describing local stability, combining quantitative and qualitative concepts. However, it remains incomplete for describing real conservation cases that combine local and global stability.},

abstract = {Climate change drivers affect plant community productivity via three pathways: (i) direct effects of drivers on plants; (ii) the response of species abundances to drivers (community response); and (iii) the feedback effect of community change on productivity (community effect). The contribution of each pathway to driver-productivity relationships depends on functional traits of dominant species. We used data from three experiments in Texas, USA, to assess the role of community dynamics in the aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) response of C4 grasslands to two climate drivers applied singly: atmospheric CO2 enrichment and augmented summer precipitation. The ANPPdriver response differed among experiments because community responses and effects differed. ANPP increased by 80-120 g m -2 per 100 $\mu$l l-1 rise in CO2 in separate experiments with pasture and tallgrass prairie assemblages. Augmenting ambient precipitation by 128 mm during one summer month each year increased ANPP more in native than in exotic communities in a third experiment. The community effect accounted for 21-38{\%} of the ANPP CO2 response in the prairie experiment but little of the response in the pasture experiment. The community response to CO2 was linked to species traits associated with greater soil water from reduced transpiration (e.g. greater height). Community effects on the ANPP CO2 response and the greater ANPP response of native than exotic communities to augmented precipitation depended on species differences in transpiration efficiency. These results indicate that feedbacks from community change influenced ANPP-driver responses. However, the species traits that regulated community effects on ANPP differed from the traits that determined how communities responded to drivers. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Author.},

abstract = {The robustness of communities to species loss is a major topic in ecological research. Here, we introduce the Dependent random-search Coextinction Model (DCM), a new approach for modelling the consequences of primary extinctions in ecological networks. The DCM assumes that species may persist after a primary extinction through two non-exclusive mechanisms: compensation (i.e., by increasing the interaction strength with living partners) and new interactions. In the DCM, the strengths of the compensated interactions are proportional to the dependence on the lost partner, while the strengths of new interactions are proportional to the resemblance (e.g. phylogenetic, functional) between the extinct partners and the new ones. Using simulations with mutualistic webs as templates, we show that the probability of extinction cascades and the total number of extinctions decrease in highly connected networks, and the probability of extinction cascades increased in highly nested networks. The proposed model is simple and can be used in a variety of interaction networks (e.g. mutualistic, food webs, host-parasite), with any species-species resemblances representing ecological or evolutionary dissimilarities.},

abstract = {Knowledge of feeding rates is the basis to understand interaction strength and subsequently the stability of ecosystems and biodiversity. Feeding rates, as all biological rates, depend on consumer and resource body masses and environmental temperature. Despite five decades of research on functional responses as quantitative models of feeding rates, a unifying framework of how they scale with body masses and temperature is still lacking. This is perplexing, considering that the strength of functional responses (i.e. interaction strengths) is crucially important for the stability of simple consumer-resource systems and the persistence, sustainability and biodiversity of complex communities. Here, we present the largest currently available database on functional response parameters and their scaling with body mass and temperature. Moreover, these data are integrated across ecosystems and metabolic types of species. Surprisingly, we found general temperature dependencies that differed from the Arrhenius terms predicted by metabolic models. Additionally, the body-mass-scaling relationships were more complex than expected and differed across ecosystems and metabolic types. At local scales (taxonomically narrow groups of consumer - resource pairs), we found hump-shaped deviations from the temperature and body-mass-scaling relationships. Despite the complexity of our results, these body-mass-and temperature-scaling models remain useful as a mechanistic basis for predicting the consequences of warming for interaction strengths, population dynamics and network stability across communities differing in their size structure. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Experimental studies assessing climatic effects on ecological communities have typically applied static warming treatments. Although these studies have been informative, they have usually failed to incorporate either current or predicted future, patterns of variability. Future climates are likely to include extreme events which have greater impacts on ecological systems than changes in means alone. Here, we review the studies which have used experiments to assess impacts of temperature on marine, freshwater and terrestrial communities, and classify them into a set of 'generations' based on how they incorporate variability. The majority of studies have failed to incorporate extreme events. In terrestrial ecosystems in particular, experimental treatments have reduced temperature variability, when most climate models predict increased variability. Marine studies have tended to not concentrate on changes in variability, likely in part because the thermal mass of oceans will moderate variation. In freshwaters, climate change experiments have a much shorter history than in the other ecosystems, and have tended to take a relatively simple approach. We propose a new 'generation' of climate change experiments using down-scaled climate models which incorporate predicted changes in climatic variability, and describe a process for generating data which can be applied as experimental climate change treatments. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd/CNRS.},

We discover that animal species that interact with a low diversity of plant species have narrow climatic niches and are most vulnerable to climate change. In contrast, biotic specialization of plants is not related to climatic niche breadth and vulnerability. A simulation model incorporating different scenarios of species coextinction and capacities for partner switches shows that projected plant extinctions under climate change are more likely to trigger animal coextinctions than vice versa. This result demonstrates that impacts of climate change on biodiversity can be amplified via extinction cascades from plants to animals in ecological networks.},

abstract = {1. Understanding the structure of ecological networks is a crucial task for interpreting community and ecosystem responses to global change. 2. Despite the recent interest in this subject, almost all studies have focused exclusively on one specific network property. The question remains as to what extent different network properties are related and how understanding this relationship can advance our comprehension of the mechanisms behind these patterns. 3. Here, we analysed the relationship between nestedness and modularity, two frequently studied network properties, for a large data set of 95 ecological communities including both plant-animal mutualistic and host-parasite networks. 4. We found that the correlation between nestedness and modularity for a population of random matrices generated from the real communities decreases significantly in magnitude and sign with increasing connectance independent of the network type. At low connectivities, networks that are highly nested also tend to be highly modular; the reverse happens at high connectivities. 5. The above result is qualitatively robust when different null models are used to infer network structure, but, at a finer scale, quantitative differences exist. We observed an important interaction between the network structure pattern and the null model used to detect it. 6. A better understanding of the relationship between nestedness and modularity is important given their potential implications on the dynamics and stability of ecological communities. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {Introduction The fundamental goal of food-web ecology is to understand essential ecosystem components, their features, and interactions such that predictions about dynamics can be made with reasonable precision and accuracy. The degree to which ecologists can be successful in this endeavor is critical for management of fisheries, invasive species, agricultural pests, infectious diseases, and a host of other ecological challenges. A frequently recognized, yet rarely addressed, challenge in food-web modeling is the diversity of responses to environmental variation by organisms with different combinations of functional traits, such as those that define life-history strategies. Spatial and temporal variation of influential environmental variables differentially affects recruitment and population dynamics of species having divergent life-history strategies. This, in turn, affects their interactions with resources and each other. This chapter briefly examines the relationship between life-history theory and food-web ecology, and then discusses how this relationship affects ecological applications using fisheries management as an example. Models that focus solely on networks of consumer–resource interactions without accounting for interspecific differences in responses to environmental variation cannot simulate real-world food-web dynamics. Individual-based models can simulate interactions among organisms with divergent traits as well as responses to environmental factors, and recently developed individual-based models have shown good potential for predicting food-web dynamics. Identification of manageable sets of influential functional traits is critical for success. Validation of individual-based models requires extensive empirical data at multiple hierarchy levels, ranging from individual to population, and spatio-temporal scales. This chapter briefly explores evidence for abiotic environmental mediation of population and trophic dynamics, and the potential for individual-based modeling approaches to simulate the dynamics of food webs supporting multispecies fisheries. Food-Web Paradigms Food-web ecology has progressed from crude descriptions toward modeling dynamics in complex systems. The basic food-web paradigm originated with descriptions of predator–prey networks (Camerano, 1880; Summerhayes and Elton, 1923), followed by estimates of productivity and energy assimilation within networks of functional groups (Lindeman, 1942). Although these depictions of food webs appear crude by today's standards, these works ushered in new perspectives in ecology that shifted lines of inquiry away from autecology with a focus on organismal responses to environmental gradients and patterns of species abundance and distribution, toward an emphasis on species interactions and local population dynamics.},

abstract = {1. A quantitative parasitoid web was constructed describing the trophic relationships between the community of aphids, parasitoids and secondary parasitoids in an abandoned field in southern England. Root aphids were omitted and secondary parasitoids were associated with aphids rather than primary parasitoids. All aphids, parasitoids and trophic links were expressed in the same units (m-2). Over a 2-year period, separate webs were constructed for every month that aphids and parasitoids were active in the field. 2. Twenty-six species of plants were attacked by 25 species of aphid which were parasitized by 18 species of primary parasitoids. The primary parasitoids were attacked by 28 species of secondary parasitoids, of which 18 directly attacked the still living aphid (hyperparasitoids) and 10 attacked the aphid after mummification (mummy parasitoids). The aphids were attended by three species of ants. 3. Eleven webs were constructed for the months May to September 1994 and May to October 1995. Aphids and primary parasitoids were most abundant and diverse in June, and secondary parasitoids one month later. 4. The ratios of the number of aphid species to the number of species of primary parasitoid and hyperparasitoid were relatively constant across webs, as was the ratio, of the number of links involving hyperparasitoids and mummy parasitoids. The ratio of the total number of links to the total number of species increased with web size. 5. The relative abundance of the species in the different webs was well described by a Dirichlet distribution with a common parameter. This implies a gamma distribution of aphid abundances in the field with few common and many rare species. 6. Predator (i.e. parasitoid) overlap graphs were constructed to assess the potential for indirect interactions between aphids. Mummy parasitoids were the most important group linking different aphids. A quantitative overlap diagram was developed to illustrate the potential strengths of indirect linkages. Common aphid species shared few strong, indirect links via primary parasitoids or hyperparasitoids, but could be strongly linked by mummy parasitoids. Symmetrical links were uncommon, and rare species were potentially strongly influenced by the presence of common aphids with which they shared parasitoids. 7. Ant-attended aphids were attacked by fewer species of primary parasitoids and hyperparasitoids than those species not attended by ants. Species of mummy parasitoids attack, on average, approximately twice the number of host species than species of either primary parasitoids or hyperparasitoids.},

The problem of detecting and characterizing this community structure is one of the outstanding issues in the study of networked systems. One highly effective approach is the optimization of the quality function known as "modularity" over the possible divisions of a network. Here I show that the modularity can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of a characteristic matrix for the network, which I call the modularity matrix, and that this expression leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of demonstrably higher quality than competing methods in shorter running times. I illustrate the method with applications to several published network data sets. {\textcopyright} 2006 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Human activities drive biotic homogenization (loss of regional diversity) of many taxa. However, whether species interaction networks (e.g., food webs) can also become homogenized remains largely unexplored. Using 48 quantitative parasitoid-host networks replicated through space and time across five tropical habitats, we show that deforestation greatly homogenized network structure at a regional level, such that interaction composition became more similar across rice and pasture sites compared with forested habitats. This was not simply caused by altered consumer and resource community composition, but was associated with altered consumer foraging success, such that parasitoids were more likely to locate their hosts in deforested habitats. Furthermore, deforestation indirectly homogenized networks in time through altered mean consumer and prey body size, which decreased in deforested habitats. Similar patterns were obtained with binary networks, suggesting that interaction (link) presence-absence data may be sufficient to detect network homogenization effects. Our results show that tropical agroforestry systems can support regionally diverse parasitoid-host networks, but that removal of canopy cover greatly homogenizes the structure of these networks in space, and to a lesser degree in time. Spatiotemporal homogenization of interaction networks may alter coevolutionary outcomes and reduce ecological resilience at regional scales, but may not necessarily be predictable from community changes observed within individual trophic levels. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Debate about control of interaction strength among species is fueled by variation in environmental contexts affecting food webs. We used extensive surveys and two field experiments to testthe individual and interactive influences of variation in the assemblages and associated traits of grazers as shaped by the legacy of disturbance, nutrient limitation and the presence of top predators on the accrual ofbasal resources. We quantified hydrologic variation and streambed movement to describe the legacy of disturbance and sampled biota of 20 streams over five years in a high-elevation catchment in Colorado, USA. Grazer assemblages switched from caddisfly-dominated to mayfly-dominated as disturbance increased. We manipulated the composition of grazer assemblages and the availability of nutrients (N andP) within flow-through mesocosms assembled adjacent to 10 streams, and also deployed larger in-stream channels manipulating the presence of top predators (brook trout) in five streams varying in disturbanceregimes. In both experiments we compared the rate of accrual of benthic algae and the strength of grazeralgal interactions among treatments. We observed no indirect effects of top predators on grazer mobility, grazer consumption of algae, or accrual of algal biomass (no trophic cascades). However, in both experiments accrual rates of algae yielded a unimodal pattern and grazer impacts on algae decreased withincreasing disturbance, but only at ambient (limiting) nutrient conditions. When nutrients were amended in the mesocosm experiment, algal accrual was uniformly high and grazer impacts on algae wereconsistently low. Reduced algae accrual at high disturbance levels may be explained by direct effects of environmental harshness on algae, and at low disturbance by indirect effects on grazer traits (behaviors) rather than on grazer density. In more benign streams per capita and per unit biomass grazer impacts on algae were high and drift dispersal was low, both behaviors that reduced accrual of algae.We conclude thatnutrient limitation and indirect effects of disturbance on accrual of algae mediated by grazer traits can be stronger than indirect effects of predators on algae, providing a new contribution to the debate about theinfluence of environmental context on the strength of food web interactions.},

These models may be suitable for analysing locational data obtained by such sampling methods as radio tracking or live trapping. The most useful methods for analysing home range data sets involve describing an animal's range by a probability density function of location, called the utilization distribution. Robust methods of estimation of the utilization distribution are related to the estimation of the probability function, Of this type of approach, the method of Ford and Krumme is criticised. The Harmonic Mean method of Dixon and Chapman is shown to be an improper form of the statistical method of kernel estimation. A comparison of the properties of all the models for home range considered here shows that both the Fourier Transform method proposed by D.J. Anderson and the kernel method are good because of their flexibility. The assumption of independence of locational observations which is often made is discussed and shown to be important, especially for data collected by radio tracking.

abstract = {Feedbacks of terrestrial ecosystems to atmospheric and climate change depend on soil ecosystem dynamics. Soil ecosystems can directly and indirectly respond to climate change. For example, warming directly alters microbial communities by increasing their activity. Climate change may also alter plant community composition, thus indirectly altering the soil communities that depend on their inputs. To better understand how climate change may directly and indirectly alter soil ecosystem functioning, we investigated old-field plant community and soil ecosystem responses to single and combined effects of elevated [CO2], warming, and precipitation in Tennessee (USA). Specifically, we collected soils at the plot level (plant community soils) and beneath dominant plant species (plant-specific soils). We used microbial enzyme activities and soil nematodes as indicators for soil ecosystem functioning. Our study resulted in two main findings: (1) Overall, while there were some interactions, water, relative to increases in [CO2] and warming, had the largest impact on plant community composition, soil enzyme activity, and soil nematodes. Multiple climate-change factors can interact to shape ecosystems, but in our study, those interactions were largely driven by changes in water. (2) Indirect effects of climate change, via changes in plant communities, had a significant impact on soil ecosystem functioning, and this impact was not obvious when looking at plant community soils. Climate-change effects on enzyme activities and soil nematode abundance and community structure strongly differed between plant community soils and plant-specific soils, but also within plant-specific soils. These results indicate that accurate assessments of climate-change impacts on soil ecosystem functioning require incorporating the concurrent changes in plant function and plant community composition. Climate-change-induced shifts in plant community composition will likely modify or counteract the direct impact of atmospheric and climate change on soil ecosystem functioning, and hence, these indirect effects should be taken into account when predicting the manner in which global change will alter ecosystem functioning. {\textcopyright} 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.},

We present evidence that there are quantitative differences in the strength of trophic cascades among different venue types (enclosure, mesocosm, pond, and lake), but that the strength of trophic cascades does not diminish with increasing experiment duration. Despite the large number of studies, there have been few replicated studies of trophic cascades for longer than a summer field season, and none for the time required to estimate the long-term result of press perturbations. We therefore present the results of a 4-year study of trophic cascades in experimental ponds, to test the predictions that the addition of the top predator results in a sustained increase in the phytoplankton biomass. We found that, as predicted by our literature review, there was no decline in the strength of the trophic cascade as the experiment progressed.},

However, existing food web models do not take into account likely changes in trophic interactions ('rewiring') following species loss. We investigated structural dynamics in 12 empirically documented food webs by simulating primary species loss using three realistic removal criteria, and measured robustness in terms of subsequent secondary extinctions. In our model, novel trophic interactions can be established between predators and food items not previously consumed following the loss of competing predator species. By considering the increase in robustness conferred through rewiring, we identify a new category of species - overlap species - which promote robustness as shown by comparing simulations incorporating structural dynamics to those with static topologies. The fraction of overlap species in a food web is highly correlated with this increase in robustness; whereas species richness and connectance are uncorrelated with increased robustness. Our findings underline the importance of compensatory mechanisms that may buffer ecosystems against environmental change, and highlight the likely role of particular species that are expected to facilitate this buffering. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

@article{Cohen2003,
abstract = {This chapter demonstrates that methods to describe ecological communities can be better understood, and can reveal new patterns, by labeling each species that appears in a community's food web with the numerical abundance and average body size of individuals of that species. We illustrate our new approach, and relate it to previous approaches, by analyzing data from the pelagic community of a small lake, Tuesday Lake, in Michigan. Although many of the relationships we describe have been well studied individually, we are not aware of any single community for which all of these relationships have been analyzed simultaneously. An overview of some of the results of the present study, with further theoretical extensions, has been published elsewhere (Cohen et al., 2003). Our new approach yields four major results. Though many patterns in the structure of an ecological community have been traditionally treated as independent, they are in fact connected. In at least one real ecosystem, many of these patterns are relatively robust after a major perturbation. Some of these patterns may be predictably consistent from one community to another. Locally, however, some community characteristics need not necessarily coincide with previously reported patterns for guilds or larger geographical scales. We describe our major findings under these headings: trivariate relationships (that is, relationships combining the food web, body size, and species abundance); bivariate relationships; univariate relationships; and the effects of food web perturbation. Trivariate Relationships: Species with small body mass occur low in the food web of Tuesday Lake and are numerically abundant. Larger-bodied species occur higher in the food web and are less numerically abundant. Body size explains more of the variation in numerical abundance than does trophic height. Body mass varies almost 12 orders of magnitude and numerical abundance varies by almost 10 orders of magnitude, but biomass abundance (the product of body mass times numerical abundance) varies by far less, about 5 orders of magnitude. The nearly inverse relationship between body mass and numerical abundance, and the relative constancy of biomass, are illustrated by a new food web graph (Fig. 3), which shows the food web in the plane with axes corresponding to body mass and numerical abundance. Bivariate Relationships: The pelagic community of Tuesday Lake shows a pyramid of numbers but not a pyramid of biomass. The biomass of species increases very slowly with increasing body size, by only 2 orders of magnitude as body mass increases by 12 orders of magnitude. The biomass-body size spectrum is roughly flat, as in other studies at larger spatial scales. Prey body mass is positively correlated to predator body mass. Prey abundance and predator abundance are positively correlated for numerical abundance but not for biomass abundance. Body size and trophic height are positively correlated. Body size and numerical abundance are negatively correlated. The slope of the linear regression of log numerical abundance as a function of log body size in Tuesday Lake is not significantly different from -3{\{}plus 45 degree rule{\}}4 across all species but is significantly greater than -1 at the 5{\%} significance level. This -3{\{}plus 45 degree rule{\}}4 slope is similar to that found in studies at larger, regional scales, but different from that sometimes observed at local scales. The slope within the phytoplankton and zooplankton (each group considered separately) is much less steep than -3{\{}plus 45 degree rule{\}}4, which is in agreement with an earlier observation that the slope tends to be more negative as the range of body masses of the organisms included in a study increases. A novel combination of the food web with data on body size and numerical abundance, together with an argument based on energetic mechanisms, refines and tightens the relationship between numerical abundance and body size. The regression of log body mass as a linear function of log numerical abundance across all species has a slope not significantly different from -1, but significantly less than -3{\{}plus 45 degree rule{\}}4. The estimated slope is significantly different from the reciprocal of the estimated slope of log numerical abundance as a function of log body mass. Thus, if log body mass is viewed as an independent variable and log numerical abundance is viewed as a dependent variable, the slope of the linear relationship could be -3{\{}plus 45 degree rule{\}}4 but could not be -1 at the 5{\%} significance level. Conversely, if log numerical abundance is viewed as an independent variable and log body mass as a dependent variable, the slope of the linear relationship could be -1 but could not be -4{\{}plus 45 degree rule{\}}3 (which is the reciprocal of -3{\{}plus 45 degree rule{\}}4) at the 5{\%} significance level. While a linear relationship is a good approximation in both cases, Cohen and Carpenter (in press) showed that only the model with log body mass as the independent variable meets the assumptions of linear regression analysis for these data. Univariate Relationships: The food web of Tuesday Lake has a pyramidal trophic structure. The number of trophic links between species in nearby trophic levels is higher than would be expected if trophic links were distributed randomly among the species. Food chains are shorter than would be expected if links were distributed randomly. Species low in the food web tend to have more predators and fewer prey than species high in the web. The distribution of body size is right-log skewed. The rank-numerical abundance relationship is approximately broken-stick within phytoplankton and zooplankton while the rank-biomass abundance relationship is approximately log-normal across all species. The slope of the right tail of the body mass distribution is much less steep than has been suggested for regional scales and not log-uniform as found at local scales for restricted taxonomic groups. Effect of Food Web Perturbation: The data analyzed here were collected in 1984 and 1986. In 1985, three species of planktivorous fishes were removed and one species of piscivorous fish was introduced. The data reveal some differences between 1984 and 1986 in the community's species composition and food web. Most other community characteristics seem insensitive to this major manipulation. Different fields of ecology have focused on different subsets of the bivariate relationships illustrated here. Integration of the relationships as suggested in this chapter could bring these fields closer. The new descriptive data structure (food web plus numerical abundance and body size of each species) can promote the integration of food web studies with, for example, population biology and biogeochemistry. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {A study on the distribution and population density of the western lowland gorilla (Gorilla g. gorilla) and the central chimpanzee (Pan t. troglodytes) was undertaken between December 1997 and August 2000 in the Campo and Ma'an Forests in southwestern Cameroon. The aim of this survey was to estimate the densities of the apes in different parts of the area, to assess the importance of the region for the conservation of these endangered species and to determine the influence of human activities such as logging and hunting. The survey was based on night nest counts on a total of 665.5 km of line transects. The overall density in the Campo Forest was estimated at 0.2 gorillas/km(2) and at 0.63-0.78 chimpanzees/km(2). The overall density of chimpanzees in the Ma'an Forest was estimated at 0.8-1 individuals/km(2). Gorilla density in this area was too low to allow an estimation. The highest gorilla nest density was found in secondary forest. The gorilla density in unlogged forest was significantly lower. Chimpanzees showed a clear preference for less disturbed areas. In unlogged forest, old secondary forests (logging more than 23 years ago) and areas of recent logging with large remaining patches of primary forest, significantly higher densities were calculated than inside the more heavily exploited logging concession. In areas with both logging and high hunting pressure both species were rare or even absent. The Campo Ma'an area is considered a very important area for the conservation of gorillas and chimpanzees. Conservation measures are urgently required to reduce the impact of logging and hunting. The creation of the Campo Ma'an National Park in January 2000 is an important measure to preserve the unique biodiversity in this so far hardly protected area.},

abstract = {As participation in outdoor recreational activities escalates, land managers struggle to develop management policies that ensure coexistence of wildlife and recreation. However, this requires an understanding of how wildlife responds to various forms of recreational activities and the spatial context in which the activities occur. Therefore, we measured responses of 2 species of grassland songbirds, one species of forest songbird, and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) exposed to a pedestrian, a pedestrian accompanied by a dog on leash, and a dog alone (only for grassland birds, on and away from recreational trails. We assessed the "area of influence" for each treatment by determining the probability that an animal would flush or become alert (for mule deer only) given its perpendicular distance to a trait or a line of movement in areas without trails. When animals were disturbed, we measured flush distance (the distance between the disturbance and the animal when flushed), distance moved, and, for mule deer, alert distance the distance between the disturbance and the deer when it became alert). For all species, area of influence, flush distance, distance moved, and alert distance (for mule deer) was greater when activities occurred off-trail versus on-trail. Generally, among on-trail and off-trail treatments in grasslands for vesper sparrows (Pooecetes gramineus) and western meadowlarks (Sturnella neglecta), the smallest area of influence and shortest flush distance and distance moved resulted from the dog-alone treatment, and these responses were greater for the pedestrian-alone and dog-on-leash treatments. In forests, for American robins (Turdus migratorius), the area of influence, flush distance, and distance moved did not generally differ between the pedestrian-alone and dog-on-leash treatments. For mule deer, presence of a dog resulted in a greater area of influence, alert and flush distance, and distance moved than when a pedestrian was alone. Natural lands managers can implement spatial and behavioral restrictions in visitor management to reduce disturbance by recreational activities on wildlife. Restrictions on types of activities allowed in some areas such as prohibiting dogs or restricting use to trails will aid in minimizing disturbance. Additionally, managers can restrict the number and spatial arrangement of trails so that sensitive areas or habitats are avoided},

abstract = {In ecosystems, a single extinction event could eventually precipitate in a mass extinction, involving species that may be several connections away from the target of the perturbation. This topic has been illuminated by recent studies on network mechanics, thanks to the concepts of hub, error and targeted removal, attack sensitivity, small world, and so forth. To forecast the effects of a species removal one can use an algorithm that unfolds a complex food web into a topologically simpler scheme, called its dominator tree. This structure is simple, elegant, and highly informative; all the bottlenecks and the effects of species removal are clearly traceable. While food web studies are mostly qualitative, in this paper the use of the dominator tree is extended to weighted food webs, in which link magnitude is specified. These structures were obtained from ecological flow networks. In eight of these food webs, the analysis consisted in removing links that were weaker than a threshold of magnitude and building the dominator tree associated to the remaining structure. By progressively increasing the threshold up to the value that would make the graph disconnected, we had the opportunity to investigate patterns of dominance as a function of link magnitude. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Invasive rats have colonized most of the islands of the world, resulting in strong negative impacts on native biodiversity and on ecosystem functions. As prolific omnivores, invasive rats can cause local extirpation of a wide range of native species, with cascading consequences that can reshape communities and ecosystems. Eradication of rats on islands is now becoming a widespread approach to restore ecosystems, and many native island species show strong numerical responses to rat eradication. However, the effect of rat eradication on other consumers can extend beyond direct numerical effects, to changes in behavior, dietary composition, and other ecological parameters. These behavioral and trophic effects may have strong cascading impacts on the ecology of restored ecosystems, but they have rarely been examined. In this study, we explore how rat eradication has affected the trophic ecology of native land crab communities. Using stable isotope analysis of rats and crabs, we demonstrate that the diet or trophic position of most crabs changed subsequent to rat eradication. Combined with the numerical recovery of two carnivorous land crab species (Geograpsus spp.), this led to a dramatic widening of the crab trophic niche following rat eradication. Given the established importance of land crabs in structuring island communities, particularly plants, this suggests an unappreciated mechanism by which rat eradication may alter island ecology. This study also demonstrates the potential for stable isotope analysis as a complementary monitoring tool to traditional techniques, with the potential to provide more nuanced assessments of the community- and ecosystem-wide effects of restoration.},

abstract = {Food webs are a powerful whole-system way to represent the patterns of biodiversity and energy flow in a readily quantifiable framework amenable to comparative analyses. Integrated theory and data on complex trophic interactions provide useful and novel ways to study ecosystem structure, dynamics, function and stability. Freshwater ecology has contributed considerably to the advancement of food-web ecology. This has occurred through early application of methodological advances such as stable isotope analysis and description of some of the most detailed food webs, including Little Rock Lake and the Broadstone Stream food webs. Freshwater food webs are often highly resolved, although the inclusion of components such as bacteria continues to be challenging. Characteristics of stream food webs appear to include high rates of omnivory and a strong role for body size as a structuring influence. While freshwater ecology has often included landscape factors, food webs from freshwaters have most often been collected at small spatial scales. There is a need to take a landscape approach to the study of food-web dynamics in freshwater ecosystems. Studies of food webs that take an experimental approach or utilise natural gradients remain rare but will be vital to untangling causative relationships between changing environmental conditions and food-web structure and dynamics. Emerging directions in freshwater food-web research involve integrating individual-level variation and information on traits into food-web studies. This is allowing a growing understanding of the ways in which food webs can be used to integrate community, evolutionary and population processes into studies of biodiversity.

abstract = {We develop individual-based movement ecology models (MEM) to explore turkey vulture (Cathartes aura) migration decisions at both hourly and daily scales. Vulture movements in 10 migration events were recorded with satellite-reporting GPS sensors, and flight behavior was observed visually, aided by on-the-ground VHF radio-tracking. We used the North American Regional Reanalysis dataset to obtain values for wind speed, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE), and cloud height and used a digital elevation model for a measure of terrain ruggedness. A turkey vulture fitted with a heart-rate logger during 124 h of flight during 38 contiguous days showed only a small increase in mean heart rate as distance traveled per day increased, which suggests that, unlike flapping, soaring flight does not lead to greatly increased metabolic costs. Data from 10 migrations for 724 hourly segments and 152 daily segments showed that vultures depended heavily upon high levels of TKE in the atmospheric boundary layer to increase flight distances and maintain preferred bearings at both hourly and daily scales. We suggest how the MEM can be extended to other spatial and temporal scales of avian migration. Our success in relating model-derived atmospheric variables to migration indicates the potential of using regional reanalysis data, as here, and potentially other regional, higher-resolution, atmospheric models in predicting changing movement patterns of soaring birds under various scenarios of climate and land use change. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {In a rapidly changing climate, alpine plants may persist by adapting to new conditions. However, the rate at which the climate is changing might exceed the rate of adaptation through evolutionary processes in long-lived plants. Persistence may depend on phenotypic plasticity in morphology and physiology. Here we investigated patterns of leaf trait variation including leaf area, leaf thickness, specific leaf area, leaf dry matter content, leaf nutrients (C, N, P) and isotopes ($\delta$13C and $\delta$15N) across an elevation gradient on Gongga Mountain, Sichuan Province, China. We quantified inter- and intra-specific trait variation and the plasticity in leaf traits of selected species to experimental warming and cooling by using a reciprocal transplantation approach. We found substantial phenotypic plasticity in most functional traits where $\delta$15N, leaf area, and leaf P showed greatest plasticity. These traits did not correspond with traits with the largest amount of intraspecific variation. Plasticity in leaf functional traits tended to enable plant populations to shift their trait values toward the mean values of a transplanted plants' destination community, but only if that population started with very different trait values. These results suggest that leaf trait plasticity is an important mechanism for enabling plants to persist within communities and to better tolerate changing environmental conditions under climate change.},

abstract = {Gibbons, Family Hylobatidae Gray, 1870, are small, arboreal apes of the tropical and semi-deciduous forests of southeast Asia and parts of south and east Asia. Four genera and about 14 species are currently recognized; a number of them threatened with extinction. Two of the reasons for breeding gibbons in captivity are to retain species and subspecies diversity and to create a viable gene pool, with the ultimate goal of releasing animals into protected native habitat. Accurate taxonomic identification may be complicated for some gibbon species due to (1) variation in coat color, (2) sexual dichromatism, and (3) the occurrence of coat color changes from infancy through sexual maturity, and for all species because of (4) the impacts of such as malnutrition and housing on coloration (for example, their maintenance indoors only or in full sunlight), (5) the ease with which the vocalizations of the different species can be confused, (6) the difficulties in distinguishing some gibbon subspecies from each other, and (7) errors in, or the lack of, information concerning the origin of confiscated gibbons. Given these problems, it is not surprising that rescue and breeding centers encounter difficulties in identifying the gibbons they receive. I review the characteristics and identifying features of the species and subspecies of gibbons, including information from museum specimens, live gibbons housed at the Gibbon Conservation Center, Santa Clarita, California, and a number of zoos worldwide.},

abstract = {Understanding the factors that shape community assembly remains one of the most enduring and important questions in modern ecology. Network theory can reveal rules of community assembly within and across study systems and suggest novel hypotheses regarding the formation and stability of communities. However, such studies generally face the challenge of disentangling the relative influence of factors such as interaction type and environmental conditions on shaping communities and associated networks. Endophytic and endolichenic symbioses, characterized by microbial species that occur within healthy plants and lichen thalli, represent some of the most ubiquitous interactions in nature. Fungi that engage in these symbioses are hyperdiverse, often horizontally transmitted, and functionally beneficial in many cases, and they represent the diversification of multiple phylogenetic groups. We evaluated six measures of ecological network structure for {\textgreater}4100 isolates of endophytic and endolichenic fungi collected systematically from five sites across North America. Our comparison of these co-occurring interactions in biomes ranging from tundra to subtropical forest showed that the type of interactions (i.e., endophytic vs. endolichenic) had a much more pronounced influence on network structure than did environmental conditions. In particular, endophytic networks were less nested, less connected, and more modular than endolichenic networks in all sites. The consistency of the network structure within each interaction type, independent of site, is encouraging for current efforts devoted to gathering metadata on ecological network structure at a global scale. We discuss several mechanisms potentially responsible for such patterns and draw attention to knowledge gaps in our understanding of networks for diverse interaction types.},

abstract = {Forcibly removing species from ecosystems has important consequences for
the remaining assemblage, leading to changes in community structure,
ecosystem functioning and secondary (cascading) extinctions. One key
question that has arisen from single- and multi-trophic ecosystem models
is whether the secondary extinctions that occur within competitive
communities (guilds) are also important in multi-trophic ecosystems? The
loss of consumer-resource links obviously causes secondary extinction of
specialist consumers (topological extinctions), but the importance of
secondary extinctions in multi-trophic food webs driven by direct
competitive exclusion remains unknown. Here I disentangle the effects of
extinctions driven by basal competitive exclusion from those caused by
trophic interactions in a multi-trophic ecosystem (basal producers,
intermediate and top consumers). I compared food webs where basal
species either show diffuse (all species compete with each other
identically: no within guild extinctions following primary extinction)
or asymmetric competition (unequal interspecific competition: within
guild extinctions are possible). Basal competitive exclusion drives
extra extinction cascades across all trophic levels, with the effect
amplified in larger ecosystems, though varying connectance has little
impact on results. Secondary extinction patterns based on the relative
abundance of the species lost in the primary extinction differ
qualitatively between diffuse and asymmetric competition. Removing
asymmetric basal species with low (high) abundance triggers fewer (more)
secondary extinctions throughout the whole food web than removing
diffuse basal species. Rare asymmetric competitors experience less
pressure from consumers compared to rare diffuse competitors.
Simulations revealed that diffuse basal species are never involved in
extinction cascades, regardless of the trophic level of a primary
extinction, while asymmetric competitors were. This work highlights
important qualitative differences in extinction patterns that arise when
different assumptions are made about the form of direct competition in
multi-trophic food webs.},

abstract = {A large body of research has revealed (often) positive biodiversity-ecosystem functioning (B-EF) relationships in manipulative experiments. The vast majority of such studies have focused on either micro- or macro-organisms, and none we are aware of have manipulated the diversity of both simultaneously under controlled laboratory conditions. We performed a microcosm experiment in which we manipulated species richness of aquatic fungi and invertebrates, two taxonomically distant sets of consumers that contribute to the same key ecosystem process in freshwaters, the decomposition of terrestrial leaf litter. We used a novel statistical design to maximize parsimony and analytical power in an experiment with three levels of species richness (seven mono-culture, 21 di-culture, and seven tri-culture treatments). Litter decomposition was measured as both leaf mass loss and the production of fine particulate organic matter (FPOM). We tested whether species richness affected these two processes or whether polycultures performed as predicted from their component mono-cultures. Further, we calculated assemblage metabolism in each microcosm to test whether the processes were driven by the metabolic demands of fungi and invertebrates. In general, across the 35 treatments, most species combinations performed in an additive fashion and we found no effect of species richness on either process. There was evidence of assemblage identity effects (i.e. certain species combinations not performing as expected), with instances of significant differences for species combinations that contained both caddis larvae and fungi. These assemblages performed worse than expected, which might have been due to dual vertical and horizontal interactions, with the possibility that although both consumed litter directly the former may also have grazed on the latter. Apart from these particular species combinations, overall performance of a species in polyculture was effectively the same as in mono-culture and reflected its metabolic demands. This suggests that even taxonomically distant consumers might exhibit a degree of functional redundancy for certain processes provided the remaining species can attain sufficient population biomass (and hence metabolic capacity) to compensate for the loss of other species, although whether such compensatory mechanisms operate in the field remains unknown. Further species contribute to a multitude of ecosystem processes and progressively more species are needed to sustain the sum of them. Our experiment highlights how, by taking metabolic demands into account, future B-EF studies could help to disentangle how species contribute to ecosystem processes both separately and in combination, and to help partition the effects of taxonomic and functional diversity. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Plant–animal interactions are fundamentally important in ecosystems, but have often been ignored by studies of climate-change impacts on biodiversity. Here, we present a trait-based framework for predicting the responses of interacting plants and animals to climate change. We distinguish three pathways along which climate change can impact interacting species in ecological communities: (i) spatial and temporal mismatches in the occurrence and abundance of species, (ii) the formation of novel interactions and secondary extinctions, and (iii) alterations of the dispersal ability of plants. These pathways are mediated by three kinds of functional traits: response traits, matching traits, and dispersal traits. We propose that incorporating these traits into predictive models will improve assessments of the responses of interacting species to climate change.},

abstract = {Current global changes make it important to be able to predict which interactions will occur in the emerging ecosystems. Most of the current methods to infer the existence of interactions between two species require a good knowledge of their behaviour or a direct observation of interactions. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by developing a method, inspired from the niche model of food web structure, using the statistical relationship between predator and prey body size to infer the matrix of potential interactions among a pool of species. The novelty of our approach is to infer, for any species of a given species pool, the three species-specific parameters of the niche model. The method applies to both local and metaweb scales. It allows one to evaluate the feeding interactions of a new species entering the community. We find that this method gives robust predictions of the structure of food webs and that its efficiency is increased when the strength of the body-size relationship between predators and preys increases. We finally illustrate the potential of the method to infer the metaweb structure of pelagic fishes of the Mediterranean sea under different global change scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2013 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {The use of functional traits to describe community structure is a promising approach to reveal generalities across organisms and ecosystems. Plant ecologists have demonstrated the importance of traits in explaining community structure, competitive interactions as well as ecosystem functioning. The application of trait-based methods to more complex communities such as food webs is however more challenging owing to the diversity of animal characteristics and of interactions. The objective of this study was to determine how functional structure is related to food web structure. We consider that food web structure is the result of 1) the match between consumer and resource traits, which determine the occurence of a trophic interaction between them, and 2) the distribution of functional traits in the community. We implemented a statistical approach to assess whether or not 35 466 pairwise interactions between soil organisms are constrained by trait-matching and then used a Procrustes analysis to investigate correlations between functional indices and network properties across 48 sites. We found that the occurrence of trophic interactions is well predicted by matching the traits of the resource with those of the consumer. Taxonomy and body mass of both species were the most important traits for the determination of an interaction. As a consequence, functional evenness and the variance of certain traits in the community were correlated to trophic complementarity between species, while trait identity, more than diversity, was related to network topology. The analysis was however limited by trait data availability, and a coarse resolution of certain taxonomic groups in our dataset. These limitations explain the importance of taxonomy, as well as the complexity of the statistical model needed. Our results outline the important implications of trait composition on ecological networks, opening promising avenues of research into the relationship between functional diversity and ecosystem functioning in multi-trophic systems.},

abstract = {Important species may be in critically central network positions in ecological interaction networks. Beyond quantifying which one is the most central species in a food web, a multinode approach can identify the key sets of the most central n species as well. However, for sets of different size n, these structural keystone species complexes may differ in their composition. If larger sets contain smaller sets, higher nestedness may be a proxy for predictive ecology and efficient management of ecosystems. On the contrary, lower nestedness makes the identification of keystones more complicated. Our question here is how the topology of a network can influence nestedness as an architectural constraint. Here, we study the role of keystone species complexes in 27 real food webs and quantify their nestedness. After quantifying their topology properties, we determine their keystone species complexes, calculate their nestedness, and statistically analyze the relationship between topological indices and nestedness. A better understanding of the cores of ecosystems is crucial for efficient conservation efforts, and to know which networks will have more nested keystone species complexes would be a great help for prioritizing species that could preserve the ecosystem's structural integrity.},

abstract = {Mountain ecosystems will likely be affected by global warming during the 21st century, with substantial biodiversity loss predicted by species distribution models (SDMs). Depending on the geographic extent, elevation range, and spatial resolution of data used in making these models, different rates of habitat loss have been predicted, with associated risk of species extinction. Few coordinated across-scale comparisons have been made using data of different resolutions and geographic extents. Here, we assess whether climate change-induced habitat losses predicted at the European scale (10 × 10′ grid cells) are also predicted from local-scale data and modeling (25 m × 25 m grid cells) in two regions of the Swiss Alps. We show that local-scale models predict persistence of suitable habitats in up to 100{\%} of species that were predicted by a European-scale model to lose all their suitable habitats in the area. Proportion of habitat loss depends on climate change scenario and study area. We find good agreement between the mismatch in predictions between scales and the fine-grain elevation range within 10 × 10′ cells. The greatest prediction discrepancy for alpine species occurs in the area with the largest nival zone. Our results suggest elevation range as the main driver for the observed prediction discrepancies. Local-scale projections may better reflect the possibility for species to track their climatic requirement toward higher elevations. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing.},

abstract = {The structure and organisation of aquatic communities, moulded in each environment by combinations of abiotic factors, recruitment and productivity rates, rely upon a network of both pairwise and transitive interactions among organisms. In many cases, a few strong interactors drive basic ecological processes by playing a leading role in channelling the available resources. Among these, keystone species may control the outputs of local biodiversity through large indirect effects, disproportionately large relative to their abundance. Functional roles are not fixed labels, and species interactions have variable outputs in both time and space: also, in spite of a growing literature on species interactions, terminology is often poorly applied. This leads to the loss of the informative value of concepts, like the keystone species, which might represent useful trade-offs between science and environmental politics. Species' roles are often used to set taxonomic conservation priorities, although this might even be regarded as unethical, ecologically wrong, or in disregard of the evolutionary meaning of species coexistence and interaction. A re-assessment of species' roles is given here, attempting to highlight their limits and applicability.

The Zostera meadows were always the most productive habitat (145-225 g ash-free dry weight m(-2) year(-1)). In the short term, the macroalgal bloom benefited the total estuarine production by enhancing the annual production in the eutrophied area. Nevertheless, our results show that this increase was short lived and in no way sufficient to match the production in the Zostera meadows.

abstract = {Habitat fragmentation is a leading threat to global biodiversity. Dispersal plays a key role in gene flow and population viability, but the impact of fragmentation on dispersal patterns remains poorly understood. Among chimpanzees, males typically remain in their natal communities while females often disperse. However, habitat loss and fragmentation may cause severe ecological disruptions, potentially resulting in decreased fitness benefits of male philopatry and limited female dispersal ability. To investigate this issue, we genotyped nearly 900 non‐invasively collected chimpanzee fecal samples across a fragmented forest habitat that may function as a corridor between two large continuous forests in Uganda, and used the spatial associations among co‐sampled genotypes to attribute a total of 229 individuals to 10 distinct communities, including 9 communities in the corridor habitat and 1 in continuous forest. We then used parentage analyses to infer instances of between‐community dispersal. Of the 115 parent–offspring dyads detected with confidence, members of 39{\%} (N = 26) of mother–daughter dyads were found in different communities, while members of 10{\%} (N = 5) of father–son dyads were found in different communities. We also found direct evidence for one dispersal event that occurred during the study period, as a female's sample found first in one community was found multiple times in another community 19 months later. These findings suggest that even in fragmented habitats, chimpanzee males remain in their natal communities while females tend to disperse. Corridor enhancement in unprotected forest fragments could help maintain gene flow in chimpanzees and other species amid anthropogenic pressures.},

abstract = {Aim: More powerful tests of biodiversity theories need to move beyond species richness and explicitly focus on mechanisms generating diversity via trait composition. The rise of trait-based ecology has led to an increased focus on the distribution and dynamics of traits across broad geographic and climatic gradients and how these distributions influence ecosystem function. However, a general theory of trait-based ecology, that can apply across different scales (e.g. species that differ in size) and gradients (e.g. temperature), has yet to be formulated. While research focused on metabolic and allometric scaling theory provides the basis for such a theory, it does not explicitly account for differences in traits within and across taxa, such as variation in the optimal temperature for growth. Here we synthesize trait-based and metabolic scaling approaches into a framework that we term 'Trait Driver Theory' or TDT. It shows that the shape and dynamics of trait and size distributions can be linked to fundamental drivers of community assembly and how the community will respond to future drivers. To assess predictions and assumptions of TDT, we review several theoretical studies and recent empirical studies spanning local and biogeographic gradients. Further, we analyze how the shift in trait distributions influences ecosystem processes across an elevational gradient and a 140-year-long ecological experiment. We show that TDT provides a baseline for (i) recasting the predictions of ecological theories based on species richness in terms of the shape of trait distributions and (ii) integrating how specific traits, including body size, and functional diversity then 'scale up' to influence ecosystem functioning and the dynamics of species assemblages across climate gradients. Further, TDT offers a novel framework to integrate trait, metabolic/allometric, and species-richness-based approaches to better predict functional biogeography and how assemblages of species have and may respond to climate change.},

abstract = {Species are entangled within communities by their interactions in such a manner that their local extinction may unchain coextinction cascades and impact community dynamics and stability. Despite increasing attention, simulation models to estimate the robustness of interaction networks largely neglect the important role of interaction rewiring, that is, the ability of species to switch partners. Here we propose a new method to incorporate the potential of species to replace lost partners into a widely used coextinction model to estimate network robustness. In this model, species are allowed to rewire their interactions after initial loss of partners according to probabilities derived from well-known mechanisms that determine mutualistic interactions, for example, trait matching, phenological overlap and abundances. To illustrate the use of this method, we analyzed a well-sampled dataset of mutualistic plant–hummingbird interactions. We found that (a) in general, rewiring increases the estimated robustness, (b) networks are similarly robust to the loss of pollinators or plants, (c) morphological matching and phenological overlap leads to higher robustness, (d) when multiple rewiring mechanisms are combined, however, robustness increases little, and (e) rewiring tends to increase robustness more in scenarios when the loss of generalist species occurs first. Our results suggest that the same mechanisms known to drive plant–hummingbird network structure are relevant in buffering the effects of species loss via rewiring. The method proposed here can be applied to a wide range of interaction networks and is flexible to the inclusion of other variables important in determining interactions for specific systems. It also allows changes on the assumptions regarding the importance of distinct mechanisms, for instance including a hierarchical relationship, which facilitates insights into the relative importance of multiple variables influencing network disassembling. The analytical framework we offer here represents a step towards a more realistic estimation on how species loss may affect the integrity of interaction networks.},

abstract = {Matrix models for a metapopulation can be formulated in two ways: in terms of the stage distribution within each spatial patch, or in terms of the spatial distribution within each stage. In either case, the entries of the projection matrix combine demographic and dispersal information in potentially complicated ways. We show how to construct such models from a simple block-diagonal formulation of the demographic and dispersal processes, using a special permutation matrix called the vec-permutation matrix. This formulation makes it easy to calculate and interpret the sensitivity and elasticity of $\lambda$ to changes in stage- and patch-specific demographic and dispersal parameters. {\textcopyright} 2005 Christine M.

abstract = {In a large-scale outdoor mesocosm experiment we studied the effects of salinity on successional patterns, diversity, and relative abundances of Camargue (southern France) temporary pool crustaceans. Eighty mesocosms were inoculated with a mixed resting egg bank and exposed to four different salinity treatments (0.5, 1.0, 2.5, and 5.0 g L-1) for a period of 7 months. Salinity significantly altered crustacean communities hatching from the resting egg bank through a number of direct and indirect effects. Salinity had a significant negative effect on the establishment of large branchiopods and copepods. Both richness and density of cladocerans, especially chydorids, were positively related to salinity, possibly due to the absence of biotic interactions with large branchiopods at the highest salinity values. We hypothesize that the salinity-mediated presence of the large branchiopod keystone group can shift the whole wetland regime from a zooplankton-rich clear-water state to a zooplankton-poor turbid state. Crustacean succession was significantly altered by salinity, by slowing down development rates, population growth or maturation rates of some species. This suggests that in addition to salinity changes, any alteration of wetland hydroperiod (e.g., through aridification or inappropriate water management) could have a synergistic effect on community structure and diversity of invertebrate communities, including some keystone species. {\textcopyright} 2010, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

abstract = {1. A new top predator, the dragonfly Cordulegaster boltonii, invaded Broadstone Stream (U.K.) in the mid-1990s. This provided a rare opportunity to assess the impact of a new, large carnivore on a community that has been studied since the 1970s and has one of the most detailed food webs yet published. The vulnerability of the resident species to the invader was assessed by integrating experiments, which examined discrete stages in the predation sequence, with empirical survey data. 2. Although the new predator preyed on nearly every macro-invertebrate in the food web, vulnerability varied considerably among prey species. Size-related handling constraints initially set the predator's diet, resulting in strong onto-genetic shifts, with progressively larger prey being added while small prey were retained in the diet, as predators grew. Within the size range of vulnerable prey, encounter rate limited the strength of predation, with mobile, epibenthic species being most at risk. Contrary to most studies of interactions between freshwater predators (usually stoneflies) and prey (usually mayflies), the new predator did not elicit avoidance responses from its prey, probably because it combined a highly cryptic feeding posture with an extremely rapid attack response. 3. The invader exploited its prey heavily in experiments, even at prey densities orders of magnitude above ambient. In the field, electivity reflected prey availability, as determined by mobility and microhabitat use, rather than prey abundance or active predator choice. Consequently, the invader had skewed effects within the prey assemblage, with sedentary, interstitial species being far less vulnerable than more active, epibenthic species, some of which, including a previous top predator, have declined markedly since the invasion. 4. By examining the predation sequence in detail and integrating surveys with experiments, species traits and system characteristics that determine the strength of trophic interactions may be identified, and their potential importance in natural food webs assessed. In so doing, greater insight can be gained into which species (and systems) will be most vulnerable to invading or exotic predators, an imperative in both pure and applied ecology.},

abstract = {Data from long-term ecological studies further understanding of ecosystem dynamics and can guide evidence-based management. In a quasi-natural experiment we examined long-term monitoring data on different components of the Serengeti-Mara Ecosystem to trace the effects of disturbances and thus to elucidate cause-and-effect connections between them. The long-term data illustrated the role of food limitation in population regulation in mammals, particularly in migratory wildebeest and nonmigratory buffalo. Predation limited populations of smaller resident ungulates and small carnivores. Abiotic events, such as droughts and floods, created disturbances that affected survivorship of ungulates and birds. Such disturbances showed feedbacks between biotic and abiotic realms. Interactions between elephants and their food allowed savanna and grassland communities to co-occur. With increased woodland vegetation, predators' capture of prey increased. Anthropogenic disturbances had direct (hunting) and indirect (transfer of disease to wildlife) effects. Slow and rapid changes and multiple ecosystem states became apparent only over several decades and involved events at different spatial scales. Conservation efforts should accommodate both infrequent and unpredictable events and long-term trends. Management should plan on the time scale of those events and should not aim to maintain the status quo. Systems can be self-regulating through food availability and predator-prey interactions; thus, culling may not be required. Ecosystems can occur in multiple states; thus, there may be no a priori need to maintain one natural state. Finally, conservation efforts outside protected areas must distinguish between natural change and direct human-induced change. Protected areas can act as ecological baselines in which human-induced change is kept to a minimum {\textcopyright} 2007 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract = {Introduction Species interaction network studies and biogeography have evolved independently from each other, although some remarkable exceptions exist. The prevailing wisdom is that biotic interactions rule in local-scale networks while large spatial scales are the province of climate. In this chapter we suggest that this and other cross-disciplinary boundaries are artificial, and that much progress can be made through the adoption of both a biogeographical perspective in networks and a network perspective in biogeography. We present fundamental ecological questions in which integration is needed to find answers, and highlight recent integrative efforts in both biogeography and network research. In particular, we focus on two topics. First, the importance of multispecies distribution in a changing world. And, second, the existence of large-scale gradients on community structure, by which local interactions may play a secondary role for network structure and dynamics. Moving forward, we suggest that the integration of network and biogeography research represents one of the most promising yet challenging avenues for food-web studies. The Search for Universalities in Species Interaction Networks The last decade has witnessed a revolution in the study of large species interaction networks, including food webs and mutualistic networks of free-living species – as those describing plants and their pollinators. Numerous theoretical and empirical studies have identified universal patterns and mechanisms in the way species interact across different habitat types, which in turn affect community dynamics (Dunne, 2006; Montoya et al., 2006; Bascompte, 2009; Ings et al., 2009). These interaction patterns are not only key to understanding biodiversity organization within communities, but also to predicting ecosystem stability and resistance to different components of environmental change (Montoya et al., 2006, 2009; Lurgi et al., 2012a), and important ecosystem functions, such as primary production, biogeochemical cycles, pest control, or pollination (Montoya et al., 2003; Tylianakis et al., 2007; Reiss et al., 2009; Thompson et al., 2012).},

Here, we develop a conceptual model of species and community attributes affecting secondary extinction likelihood, incorporating mechanisms that buffer organisms against partner loss. Specialized interactors, including 'cryptic specialists' with diverse but nonredundant partner assemblages, incur elevated risk. Risk is also higher for species that cannot either evolve new traits following partner loss or obtain novel partners in communities reorganizing under changing environmental conditions. Partner loss occurs alongside other anthropogenic impacts; multiple stressors can circumvent ecological buffers, enhancing secondary extinction risk. Stressors can also offset each other, reducing secondary extinction risk, a hitherto unappreciated phenomenon.

abstract = {Although some organisms have moved to higher elevations and latitudes in response to recent climate change, there is little consensus regarding the capacity of different species to track rapid climate change via range shifts. Understanding species' abilities to shift ranges has important implications for assessing extinction risk and predicting future community structure. At an expanding front, colonization rates are determined jointly by rates of reproduction and dispersal. In addition, establishment of viable populations requires that individuals find suitable resources in novel habitats. Thus, species with greater dispersal ability, reproductive rate and ecological generalization should be more likely to expand into new regions under climate change. Here, we assess current evidence for the relationship between leading-edge range shifts and species' traits. We found expected relationships for several datasets, including diet breadth in North American Passeriformes and egg-laying habitat in British Odonata. However, models generally had low explanatory power. Thus, even statistically and biologically meaningful relationships are unlikely to be of predictive utility for conservation and management. Trait-based range shift forecasts face several challenges, including quantifying relevant natural history variation across large numbers of species and coupling these data with extrinsic factors such as habitat fragmentation and availability. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

Here I review some of the issues concerning the use of forecasting in the detection of nonlinearities and possible chaos, particularly with regard to stochastic chaos. Moreover, it is shown how recent attempts to measure meaningful Lyapunov exponents for ecological data are fundamentally flawed, and that when observational noise is convolved with process noise, computing Lyapunov exponents for the real system will be difficult. Such problems pave the way for more operational definitions of dynamic complexity (cf. Yao {\&} Tong, this volume) . Aside from its use in the characterization of chaos, nonlinear forecasting can be used more broadly in pragmatic classification problems. Here I review a recent example of nonlinear forecasting as it is applied to classify human heart rhythms. In particular, it is shown how forecast nonlinearity can be a good discriminator of the physiological effects of age, and how prediction-decay may discriminate heartdisease. In so doing, I introduce a method for characterizing nonlinearity using ‘S-maps' and a method for analysing multiple short time series with composite attractors.},

abstract = {Despite the fact that the loss of a species from a community has the potential to cause a dramatic decline in biodiversity, for example through cascades of secondary extinctions, little is known about the factors contributing to the extinction risk of any particular species. Here we expand earlier modeling approaches using a dynamic food-web model that accounts for bottom-up as well as top-down effects. We investigate what factors influence a species' extinction risk and time to extinction of the non-persistent species. We identified three basic properties that affect a species' risk of extinction. The highest extinction risk is born by species with (1) low energy input (e.g. high trophic level), (2) susceptibility to the loss of energy pathways (e.g. specialists with few prey species) and (3) dynamic instability (e.g. low Hill exponent and reliance on homogeneous energy channels when feeding on similarly sized prey). Interestingly, and different from field studies, we found that the trophic level and not the body mass of a species influences its extinction risk. On the other hand, body mass is the single most important factor determining the time to extinction of a species, resulting in small species dying first. This suggests that in the field the trophic level might have more influence on the extinction risk than presently recognized.

Leslie enlarges some points left over from the previous work and applies the model to the logistic equation and prey-predator dynamics in his work from 1948. If interested in learning how to build Leslie matrices from another author, try to read Leslie's paper. READ: Introduction and example},
annote = {If we want to find the composition of the population at a certain point in time we can do it by knowing the initial population composition and its fertility and mortality rates. This can be done on a female population.
The number of individuals of a certain age will be given from the initial composition of their individuals and their fertility and mortality rate. Instead of using all the time a series of equations to do this, it's possible to use a mathematical matrices, rectangular arrays that permit to make calculations between values that they have inside. 
The composition of the stage x at the time t+1 depends from the composition of the stage x-1 at the time t and by its survival rate Px-1. The composition of the newborns at the time t+1 will depend from the composition of the stages at the time t and by their fertility rates. Logically, the fertility rates and the survival rates depend from the species. Fertility rate is the mean number of offspring per female. 
Survival rate is the probability of survival from t to t+1.
The squared matrix is multiplied to a coloumn matrix, also called coloumn vector, containing the composition of the population at time t to obtain a resultant column matrix, which contains the composition of the population at time t+1. 
Fertility rates and survival rates can be found inside the so called life tables, which associate this values with the age of the individuals. They are built out of empirical observations. 
NUMERICAL EXAMPLE
Leslie then gives an example: he shows how the prediction of growth of a brown rat (Rattus norvegicus) population can be accurate: he predicts the growth with a small error.

abstract = {Introduction: Two Types of Extinctions There are two types of species extinctions: true, or numerical extinctions, and functional extinctions. Numerical extinction – the traditional concept of extinction – occurs when the very last member of a species dies, while functional or ecological extinction occurs when a species becomes too rare to fulfill its ecological, interactive role in the ecosystem (Conner, 1988; Estes et al., 1989; Novaro et al., 2000; Jackson et al., 2001; Redford and Feinsinger, 2001; Soul{\'{e}} et al., 2003; Sekercioglu et al., 2004; McConkey and Drake, 2006; Baum and Worm, 2009; Estes et al., 2010; Anderson et al., 2011; Cury et al., 2011; Galetti et al., 2013; S{\"{a}}terberg et al., 2013; McConkey and O´Farrill, 2015; Sellman et al., 2015). It has been estimated that the current rate of numerical species extinction is about 1000 times higher than the natural background rate of extinction, on par with that of the great mass extinctions (Pereira et al., 2010; Barnosky et al., 2011; Pimm et al., 2014). In contrast, the rate of functional extinctions is largely unknown. Critical abundance thresholds or ecologically effective population sizes of species, below which they cease to function in the system of which they are parts, have been established for only a few species (McConkey and Drake, 2006; Estes et al., 2010; Cury et al., 2011). However, trophic cascades and regime shifts observed in a variety of ecosystems following declining population size of a species clearly indicate the presence of such abundance thresholds of species in many ecosystems (Frank et al., 2005; Casini et al., 2009; Estes et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2011; Ripple et al., 2014). Indeed, recent theoretical studies suggest that the frequency of functional extinctions might be disturbingly high and that even moderate declines in the densities of some species might lead to numerical extinctions of other dependent species (S{\"{a}}terberg et al., 2013; Sellman et al., 2015). In other words, a species can go functionally extinct well before the species becomes so rare that it loses its genetic and demographic viability and puts it in danger of a numerical extinction.},

abstract = {We used evolutionary programming to model innate migratory pathways of wildebeest in the Serengeti Mara Ecosystem, Tanzania and Kenya. Wildebeest annually move from the southern short-grass plains of the Serengeti to the northern woodlands of the Mara. We used satellite images to create 12 average monthly and 180 10-day surfaces from 1998 to 2003 of percentage rainfall and new vegetation. The surfaces were combined in five additive and three multiplicative models, with the weightings on rainfall and new vegetation from 0{\%} to 100{\%}. Modeled wildebeest were first assigned random migration pathways. In simulated generations, animals best able to access rainfall and vegetation were retained, and they produced offspring with similar migratory pathways. Modeling proceeded until the best pathway was stable. In a learning phase, modeling continued with the ten-day images in the objective function. The additive model, influenced 25{\%} by rainfall and 75{\%} by vegetation growth, yielded the best agreement, with a multi-resolution comparison to observed densities yielding 76.8{\%} of blocks in agreement (kappa = 0.32). Agreement was best for dry season and early wet season (kappa = 0.22-0.57), and poorest for the late wet season (0.04). The model suggests that new forage growth is a dominant correlate of wildebeest migration. {\textcopyright} 2006 by the the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Psilocybin and related hallucinogenic compounds are increasingly used in human research. However, due to limited information about potential subjective side effects, the controlled medical use of these compounds has remained controversial. We therefore analysed acute, short- and long-term subjective effects of psilocybin in healthy humans by pooling raw data from eight double-blind placebo-controlled experimental studies conducted between 1999 and 2008. The analysis included 110 healthy subjects who had received 1-4 oral doses of psilocybin (45-315$\mu$g/kg body weight). Although psilocybin dose-dependently induced profound changes in mood, perception, thought and self-experience, most subjects described the experience as pleasurable, enriching and non-threatening. Acute adverse drug reactions, characterized by strong dysphoria and/or anxiety/panic, occurred only in the two highest dose conditions in a relatively small proportion of subjects. All acute adverse drug reactions were successfully managed by providing interpersonal support and did not need psychopharmacological intervention. Follow-up questionnaires indicated no subsequent drug abuse, persisting perception disorders, prolonged psychosis or other long-term impairment of functioning in any of our subjects. The results suggest that the administration of moderate doses of psilocybin to healthy, high-functioning and well-prepared subjects in the context of a carefully monitored research environment is associated with an acceptable level of risk. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2011 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/ journalsPermissions.nav.},

In this work we compare three HS models for the estimation of commercial yield potential and the identification of suitable sites for Tapes philippinarum rearing in the Sacca di Goro lagoon (Italy) on the basis of six environmental factors. The habitat suitability index (HSI) is based on expert opinion while the habitat suitability conditional (HSC) is calibrated on observational data. The habitat suitability mixed (HSM) model is a two-part model combining expert knowledge and regression analysis: the first component of the model uses logistic regression to identify the areas in which clams are likely to be present; the second part applies the same parameter-specific suitability functions of the HSI model only in the areas previously identified as productive by the logistic component. The HS models were validated on an independent data set and estimates of potential yield of the Goro lagoon were compared. The effectiveness of the three approaches is then discussed in terms of predicted yield and identification of suitable sites for farming. {\textcopyright}2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

We found evidence of nonrandom loss of interactions with decreasing sierra size. Low interaction frequency and high specialization between interacting partners contributed additively to increase the vulnerability of interactions to disruption. Interactions between generalists in the largest sierras were ubiquitous across sierras, but many of them lost their central structural role in the smallest sierras. Thus, particular configurations of interaction networks, along with unique ecological relations and evolutionary pathways, could be lost forever after habitat reduction.},

Using this new method, the growth process of insect and mite populations (both female and male were included) can be studied with proper stage grouping. Algorithms of population growth and the calculation of intrinsic rate of increase and stable age-stage-distribution were described in detail. For the simulation work of field population ecology, a multidimensional matrix was used to display the spatial distribution of host plants and the age -stage-structure of pest population. Computer programs were designed to simulate the growth and dispersion of field population at the same time. These methods made a way to approach to the agroecosystem simulation.},

INTRODUCTION
The authors pointed out that considering only the stage of insects and not also their age wouldn't take into consideration the stage overlapping phenomenon. They also decide to include both male and females, without giving a reason for this. They also decided to consider inside their model also the distribution in space of the populations, which is not homogeneous but focused on different spots representing the trees.

AN EXAMPLE WITH DIAMONDBACK MOTH
A study example has been carried on the diamondback moth (Pultella xylostella), making the population grow on fresh leaves of cabage (Brassica oleracea).

abstract = {Most ecological processes now show responses to anthropogenic climate change. In terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems, species are changing genetically, physiologically, morphologically, and phenologically and are shifting their distributions, which affects food webs and results in new interactions. Disruptions scale from the gene to the ecosystem and have documented consequences for people, including unpredictable fisheries and crop yields, loss of genetic diversity in wild crop varieties, and increasing impacts of pests and diseases. In addition to the more easily observed changes, such as shifts in flowering phenology, we argue that many hidden dynamics, such as genetic changes, are also taking place. Understanding shifts in ecological processes can guide human adaptation strategies. In addition to reducing greenhouse gases, climate action and policy must therefore focus equally on strategies that safeguard biodiversity and ecosystems.},

In many countries, private gardens are a major component of urban green space and can provide considerable biodiversity benefits. Gardens and adjacent habitats form interconnected networks and a landscape ecology framework is necessary to understand the relationship between the spatial configuration of garden patches and their constituent biodiversity. A scale-dependent tension is apparent in garden management, whereby the individual garden is much smaller than the unit of management needed to retain viable populations. To overcome this, here we suggest mechanisms for encouraging 'wildlife-friendly' management of collections of gardens across scales from the neighbourhood to the city. {\textcopyright}2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Most studies to date have concentrated on the effects of climate change on individuals and species, with particular emphasis on the effects on phenology and physiology of organisms as well as changes in the distribution and range shifts of species. However, responses by individual species to climate change are not isolated; they are connected through interactions with others at the same or adjacent trophic levels. Also from this more complex perspective, recent case studies have emphasized evidence on the effects of climate change on biotic interactions and ecosystem services. This review highlights the 'knowns' but also 'unknowns' resulting from recent climate impact studies and reveals limitations of (linear) extrapolations from recent climate-induced responses of species to expected trends and magnitudes of future climate change. Hence, there is need not only to continue to focus on the impacts of climate change on the actors in ecological networks but also and more intensively to focus on the linkages between them, and to acknowledge that biotic interactions and feedback processes lead to highly complex, nonlinear and sometimes abrupt responses. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society.},

The myth of burn-in to obtain proper samples is discussed and multidimensional sampling is discussed. The Gibbs sampler is introduced as a special case of the MH algorithm.

abstract = {Graduate education programs in conservation science generally focus on disciplinary training and discipline-specific research skills. However, nonacademic conservation professionals often require an additional suite of skills. This discrepancy between academic training and professional needs can make it difficult for graduate students to identify the skills and experiences that will best prepare them for the conservation job market. We analyzed job advertisements for conservation-science positions and interviewed conservation professionals with experience hiring early-career conservation scientists to determine what skills employers of conservation professionals seek; whether the relative importance of skills varies by job sector (government, nonprofit, and private); and how graduate students interested in careers in conservation science might signal competency in key skills to potential employers. In job advertisements, disciplinary, interpersonal, and project-management skills were in the top 5 skills mentioned across all job sectors. Employers' needs for additional skills, like program leadership, conflict resolution and negotiation, and technical and information technology skills, varied across sectors. Our interview results demonstrated that some skills are best signaled to employers via experiences obtained outside thesis or dissertation work. Our findings suggest that graduate students who wish to be competitive in the conservation job market can benefit by gaining skills identified as important to the job sector in which they hope to work and should not necessarily expect to be competent in these skills simply by completing their chosen degree path. {\textcopyright} 2012 Society for Conservation Biology.},

abstract = {Several studies have been conducted to explain patterns of the abundance, richness and diversity of sandy-beach macrofauna; however, such analyses have ignored the overall functional structure of macrofauna communities. Few studies have examined polychaete feeding guilds on sandy beach environments. To examine the effects of environmental factors on polychaete feeding guilds on sandy beaches, 12 sandy beaches from five islands in Sepetiba Bay were sampled. A total of 24 polychaete morphospecies, grouped among 21 families, were identified in these sandy beaches. The polychaete species were classified into 10 feeding guilds, and the SDT guild (suspended-deposit feeders, discretely motile, with tentacles) was the most abundant feeding guild, with 34.2{\%} of total number of organisms. The highest trophic importance index and index of trophic diversity values were recorded on the sheltered beaches. A canonical correspondence analysis showed that the exposure rate, beach length, and grain size of the beach sediment significantly affected the polychaete feeding guild distribution and abundance. We can conclude that sheltered beaches have a higher diversity of feeding guilds than exposed beaches and that the biological descriptors of the feeding guilds are directly associated with the grain size of the sediment.

This forced the purple swamphen to concentrate in a few areas, increasing the risks from hunting or other disturbances. Recently, the effective protection of the species and the areas used by it, environmental changes such as the introduction of new farms and the creation of artificial wetlands (reservoirs) may have facilitated its expansion up the Guadalquivir river.

We define an n B × nA similarity matrix S whose real entry sij expresses how similar vertex j (in GA) is to vertex i (in GB): we say that sij is their similarity score. The similarity matrix can be obtained as the limit of the normalized even iterates of Sk+1 = BSkA T + BTSkA, where A and B are adjacency matrices of the graphs and SO is a matrix whose entries are all equal to 1. In the special case where GA = G B = G, the matrix S is square and the score s ij is the similarity score between the vertices i and j of G. We point out that Kleinberg's "hub and authority" method to identify web-pages relevant to a given query can be viewed as a special case of our definition in the case where one of the graphs has two vertices and a unique directed edge between them. In analogy to Kleinberg, we show that our similarity scores are given by the components of a dominant eigenvector of a nonnegative matrix. Potential applications of our similarity concept are numerous. We illustrate an application for the automatic extraction of synonyms in a monolingual dictionary. {\textcopyright} 2004 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.},

abstract = {In this paper, I provide data on the possible effects of group size and seasonal changes in food availability on the activity and habitat use patterns of two species of prosimian primate: the rufous lemur (Eulemur fulvus rufus) and the red-bellied lemur (Eulemur rubriventer). General and subtle seasonal differences were observed between lemur species in (1) group size and composition, (2) activity profiles, and (3) habitat use. Rufous lemur groups were larger (mean = 8 individuals) and contained more adults than red-bellied lemur groups (mean = 3 individuals). The overall degree and distribution of diurnal activity differed between lemur species and varied within species with seasonal changes in food availability. In general, rufous lemurs traveled more often than red-bellied lemurs. During food scarcity, both species increased the amount of time spent feeding, although peak feeding and traveling times differed. Both species also preferred horizontal substrates; however, during food scarcity, red-bellied lemurs used terminal branches more often while feeding than rufous lemurs. In addition, red-bellied lemurs used the lower middle story forest and rested in taller, upper canopy trees more often than rufous lemurs. Differences in activity and habitat use patterns between lemur species were more related to seasonal changes in food availability than overall differences in group size. These behavioral patterns may represent different strategies used by each lemur species to avoid directly competing for similar resources during times of food scarcity. (C) 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

It is commonly applied to population growth rates calculated from linear, models, but there has been no general approach to the analysis of nonlinear models. Nonlinearities in demographic models may arise due to density-dependence, frequency-dependence (in 2-sex. models), feedback through the environment or the economy, and recruitment subsidy due to immigration, or from the scaling inherent in calculations of proportional population structure. This paper uses matrix calculus to derive the sensitivity and elasticity of equilibria, cycles, ratios (e.g., dependency ratios), age averages and variances, temporal averages and variances, life expectancies, and population growth rates, for both age-classified and stage-classified models.

abstract = {There is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem processes in changing environments, but the mechanisms that underlie this effect are still controversial and poorly understood. Here, we extend mechanistic theory of ecosystem stability in competitive communities to clarify the mechanisms underlying diversity-stability relationships. We first explain why, contrary to a widely held belief, interspecific competition should generally play a destabilising role. We then explore the stabilising effect of differences in species' intrinsic rates of natural increase and provide a synthesis of various potentially stabilising mechanisms. Three main mechanisms are likely to operate in the stabilising effects of biodiversity on ecosystem properties: (1) asynchrony of species' intrinsic responses to environmental fluctuations, (2) differences in the speed at which species respond to perturbations, (3) reduction in the strength of competition. The first two mechanisms involve temporal complementarity between species, while the third results from functional complementarity. Additional potential mechanisms include selection effects, behavioural changes resulting from species interactions and mechanisms arising from trophic or non-trophic interactions and spatial heterogeneity. We conclude that mechanistic trait-based approaches are key to predicting the effects of diversity on ecosystem stability and to bringing the old diversity-stability debate to a final resolution. {\textcopyright} 2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {Many studies have demonstrated that the nonconsumptive effect (NCE) of predators on prey traits can alter prey demographics in ways that are just as strong as the consumptive effect (CE) of predators. Less well studied, however, is how the CE and NCE of multiple predator species can interact to influence the combined effect of multiple predators on prey mortality. We examined the extent to which the NCE of one predator altered the CE of another predator on a shared prey and evaluated whether we can better predict the combined impact of multiple predators on prey when accounting for this influence. We conducted a set of experiments with larval dragonflies, adult newts (a known keystone predator), and their tadpole prey. We quantified the CE and NCE of each predator, the extent to which NCEs from one predator alters the CE of the second predator, and the combined effect of both predators on prey mortality. We then compared the combined effect of both predators on prey mortality to four predictive models. Dragonflies caused more tadpoles to hide under leaf litter (a NCE), where newts spend less time foraging, which reduced the foraging success (CE) of newts. Newts altered tadpole behavior but not in a way that altered the foraging success of dragonflies. Our study suggests that we can better predict the combined effect of multiple predators on prey when we incorporate the influence of interactions between the CE and NCE of multiple predators into a predictive model. In our case, the threat of predation to prey by one predator reduced the foraging efficiency of a keystone predator. Consequently, the ability of a predator to fill a keystone role could be compromised by the presence of other predators. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

The 100th anniversary of the British Ecological Society in 2013 is an opportune moment to reflect on the current status of ecology as a science and look forward to high-light priorities for future work. To do this, we identified 100 important questions of fundamental importance in pure ecology. We elicited questions from ecologists working across a wide range of systems and disciplines. The 754 questions submitted (listed in the online appendix) from 388 participants were narrowed down to the final 100 through a process of discussion, rewording and repeated rounds of voting. This was done during a two-day workshop and thereafter. The questions reflect many of the important current conceptual and technical pre-occupations of ecology. For example, many questions concerned the dynamics of environmental change and complex ecosystem interactions, as well as the interaction between ecology and evolution. The questions reveal a dynamic science with novel subfields emerging. For example, a group of questions was dedicated to disease and micro-organisms and another on human impacts and global change reflecting the emergence of new subdisciplines that would not have been foreseen a few decades ago. The list also contained a number of questions that have perplexed ecologists for decades and are still seen as crucial to answer, such as the link between population dynamics and life-history evolution. Synthesis. These 100 questions identified reflect the state of ecology today. Using them as an agenda for further research would lead to a substantial enhancement in understanding of the discipline, with practical relevance for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem function. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

abstract = {Overview: Notions of community quality underlie the clustering of networks. While studies surrounding network clustering are increasingly common, a precise understanding of the realtionship between different cluster quality metrics is unknown. In this paper, we examine the relationship between stand-alone cluster quality metrics and information recovery metrics through a rigorous analysis of four widely-used network clustering algorithms-Louvain, Infomap, label propagation, and smart local moving. We consider the stand-alone quality metrics of modularity, conductance, and coverage, and we consider the information recovery metrics of adjusted Rand score, normalized mutual information, and a variant of normalized mutual information used in previous work. Our study includes both synthetic graphs and empirical data sets of sizes varying from 1,000 to 1,000,000 nodes. Cluster Quality Metrics: We find significant differences among the results of the different cluster quality metrics. For example, clustering algorithms can return a value of 0.4 out of 1 onmodularity but score 0 out of 1 on information recovery. We find conductance, though imperfect, to be the stand-alone quality metric that best indicates performance on the information recovery metrics. Additionally, our study shows that the variant of normalized mutual information used in previous work cannot be assumed to differ only slightly from traditional normalized mutual information. Network Clustering Algorithms: Smart local moving is the overall best performing algorithm in our study, but discrepancies between cluster evaluation metrics prevent us from declaring it an absolutely superior algorithm. Interestingly, Louvain performed better than Infomap in nearly all the tests in our study, contradicting the results of previous work in which Infomap was superior to Louvain. We find that although label propagation performs poorly when clusters are less clearly defined, it scales efficiently and accurately to large graphs with well-defined clusters.},

abstract = {An important step in unveiling the relation between network structure and dynamics defined on networks is to detect communities, and numerous methods have been developed separately to identify community structure in different classes of networks, such as unipartite networks, bipartite networks, and directed networks. Here, we show that the finding of communities in such networks can be unified in a general framework-detection of community structure in bipartite networks. Moreover, we propose an evolutionary method for efficiently identifying communities in bipartite networks. To this end, we show that both unipartite and directed networks can be represented as bipartite networks, and their modularity is completely consistent with that for bipartite networks, the detection of modular structure on which can be reformulated as modularity maximization. To optimize the bipartite modularity, we develop a modified adaptive genetic algorithm (MAGA), which is shown to be especially efficient for community structure detection. The high efficiency of the MAGA is based on the following three improvements we make. First, we introduce a different measure for the informativeness of a locus instead of the standard deviation, which can exactly determine which loci mutate. This measure is the bias between the distribution of a locus over the current population and the uniform distribution of the locus, i.e., the Kullback-Leibler divergence between them. Second, we develop a reassignment technique for differentiating the informative state a locus has attained from the random state in the initial phase. Third, we present a modified mutation rule which by incorporating related operations can guarantee the convergence of the MAGA to the global optimum and can speed up the convergence process. Experimental results show that the MAGA outperforms existing methods in terms of modularity for both bipartite and unipartite networks. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

The scaling of this negative relationship between body mass and abundance has important implications for resource partitioning and energy usage. Global warming over the next century is predicted to favour smaller organisms, producing steeper mass-abundance scaling and a less efficient transfer of biomass through the food web. Here, we show that the opposite effect occurs in a natural warming experiment involving 13 whole-stream ecosystems within the same catchment, which span a temperature gradient of 5-25 °C. We introduce a mechanistic model that shows how the temperature dependence of basal resource carrying capacity can account for these previously unexpected results. If nutrient supply increases with temperature to offset the rising metabolic demand of primary producers, there will be sufficient resources to sustain larger consumers at higher trophic levels. These new data and the model that explains them highlight important exceptions to some commonly assumed 'rules' about responses to warming in natural ecosystems.},

abstract = {This study evaluated the influence of human disturbance in nesting success of little tern (Sterna albifrons) and its interaction with the intrinsic seasonal variation in the birds' breeding biology. During 2003-2005 we studied little tern nesting ecology in southern Portugal in two different types of habitat: their natural habitat (sandy beaches) and a man-made habitat (salinas). In both habitat types, annual variations were found in the distribution of nest initiation over the breeding season and in the size of the clutches. The percentage of nests producing hatched chicks varied between 26.7{\%} and 66.4{\%} in different years and habitats. The main causes of hatching failure varied between years and habitats, but predation, flooding and human activities were very common. No consistent differences in breeding parameters or nesting success were found between habitats. On sandy beaches, the effect of protective measures (warning signs and wardening) on nesting success, together with differences between years and within each breeding season, were assessed using a logistic regression model. The presence/absence of protective measures was the most important predictor of nesting success, with birds being up to 34 times more likely to succeed with protective measures. Seasonal declines were found for clutch size and egg volume, and season was also an important predictor of nesting success, with nests more likely to succeed earlier in the season. Hence, earlier breeders will be those that benefit more from protective measures, suggesting that conservation efforts for little tern can be maximised if concentrated earlier in the season. {\textcopyright}2006 Elsevier Ltd.

annote = {Signage reduces the impact of human disturbance on little tern nesting success in Portugal (Medeiros et al., 2007)

In 2004 66{\%} of little terns in Portugal bred in Salinas (Catry et al., 2004). Cramp identified in 1985 the natural breeding habitats for this species as the sandy beaches (as cited in Medeiros et al., 2007). The main factors explaining the decline of their breeding success are predation rates (which could have been increased by introduction of predators by humans) and human disturbance (Medeiros et al., 2007). Human disturbance might influence their breeding success because of their effort of defending their clutches (they spend more time and energy in it) (Hill et al., 1997). Protective measures toward little terns' colonies have been found successful in improving their breeding success in the past, because they released the human disturbance pressure (Burger, 1984; Erwin, 1989; Fasola and Canova, 1996; Lafferty et al., 2006). It is particularly important to protect the nesting birds that nest at the beginning of the season because they are the ones that really matter (Medeiros et al., 2007). 

They produce the highest number of eggs (clutch size), and the biggest eggs (clutch volume) Medeiros et al., 2007).

The individuals that breed later in the season are birds that failed the first time, young birds and poor breeders (Coulson, 1963; Massey and Fancher, 1989; Burger et al., 1996). 

(Medeiros et al., 2007) hypothesise that there is no difference in breeding success between the salinas and the sandy beaches. 

However, salinas sometimes are left unmanaged, vegetation covers its sites and birds leave their nests (Kotliar {\&} Burger, 1984). 

We should be prepared to save these birds' habitat not by protecting the salinas that are likely to disappear in the next decades but by facilitating a transition between the salinas and the sandy beaches (my thought).

The zoning scheme protects the waders' breeding zones especially early during the season (my thought). 

Birds that nest for the first time and birds that nest in poorer condition have smaller number of eggs, smaller eggs, smaller hutching and fledging success. Human disturbance is likely to be one of the main reasons of the population decline. In 2004 its population was declining, and it has been classified as unfavourable conservation status species in the Species of European Conservation Concern list. 
Little terns naturally breed on sandy beaches. Since the 1980s because of human disturbance and habitat loss they moved to human made habitats called salinas. In 2004 the 66{\%} of Portuguese little terns was breeding on salinas. 
The authors didn't find any difference in reproductive success between salinas and sandy beaches. He hypothesizes that the differences between the two are due to annual fluctuations. 
There has been an increase in salinas' abandonment in the past 30 years, which led to the growth of grasses that brought the little tern to abandon their nests. 
Sandy beaches are better breeding sites for little terns because they are closer to the see, where little terns can fish preys that are better for the chicks' growth. The main reasons why little terns reproduce poorly is due to human disturbance and predation. However, conservation strategies to protect little terns have been applied and caused a better reproductive success.},

Our simulations illustrate how isolated communities deteriorate as populations go extinct when the environment moves outside the species' thermal niches.

This location was ideal for investigating the effects of landscape structure on habitat suitability due to the topographic variation of the landscape and the Critically Endangered status of the Western chimpanzee. Additionally, this is the only mountainous, long-term chimpanzee study site and little is known about the effects of topography on chimpanzee behavior. Suitable habitat was predicted based on the location of direct and indirect signs of chimpanzee presence and the spatial distribution of 12 biophysical variables within the study area. Model performance was assessed by examining the area under the curve. The overall predictive performance of the model was 0.721. The variables most influencing habitat suitability were the normalized difference vegetation index (37.8{\%}), elevation (27.3{\%}), hierarchical slope position (11.5{\%}), surface brightness (6.6{\%}), and distance to rivers (5.4{\%}). The final model highlighted the isolation and fragmentation of chimpanzee habitat within the Greater Nimba Landscape. Understanding the factors influencing chimpanzee habitat suitability, specifically the biophysical variables considered in this study, will greatly contribute to conservation efforts by providing quantitative habitat information and improving survey efficiency.},

abstract = {Marine ecosystem models often contain modules for two phytoplankton compartments (flagellates and diatoms) and two zooplankton groups (micro- and mesozooplankton). The models rarely include fish, not even as an agent in zooplankton mortality, which is often formulated as a constant rate. This mortality rate is treated as a free parameter, which can be used to tune or stabilize the model. There are major gaps in our knowledge and modelling capabilities of interactions at the higher trophic levels for example with regards to movement of fish at different scales, prey selection, and zooplankton responses to predators. Here, we argue that there are good reasons for making zooplankton mortality dependent on some key environmental variables known to affect the interaction strength between zooplankton and fish. In addition, since fish are highly mobile organisms, often moving in large groups, there is a need to better understand and model their horizontal migration and to include this in ecosystem models. We present basic models for light-dependent encounters between fish and their zooplankton prey and illustrate how predator-prey interactions can be modelled for herring-Calanus and cod-capelin interactions using individual-based models with super-individuals. In the latter two cases individual displacement is determined by movement behaviour and ocean circulation, and growth and mortality become emergent properties resulting from local encounters between predators and prey. Similarly movement behaviours emerge from simple adaptive rules or more complex models where behavioural strategies are evolved using a genetic algorithm. Such models are versatile and we argue that emergent mortality and growth rates resulting from adaptive behaviours and key environmental forcing are essential for realistic representation of fish-zooplankton interactions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Estimates of population size, density, and biomass revealed a population whose groups were stable in size and composition. Demographic processes' place gibbons at risk, however, to short-term changes in their environment. Patterns of survival, fecundity, mortality, and dispersal combined to produce negative rates of growth. In addition, a top-heavy age-class distribution, with adults forming a large fraction of animals, makes it unlikely that this population could recover rapidly from a decline in numbers. Two behavioral factors, territoriality and monogamy, account for the size and stability of gibbon groups. Monogamy imposes limits on group size, while mating patterns and territoriality decrease the impact of sources of high mortality common in other primate species. These relationships underscore the fundamental importance of behavioral influence on demographic processes and social structure.},

We test this space-for-time assumption by combining a spatial gradient study with whole-community turf transplantation along temperature and precipitation gradients in a network of 12 grassland sites in Southern Norway. Using data on eight traits for 169 species and annual vegetation censuses of 235 turfs over 5 yr, we quantify trait-based responses to climate change by comparing observed community dynamics in transplanted turfs to feld-parameterized null model simulations. Three traits related to species architecture (maximum height, number of dormant meristems, and rametramet connection persistence) varied consistently along spatial temperature gradients and also correlated to changes in species abundances in turfs transplanted to warmer climates. Two traits associated with resource acquisition strategy (SLA, leaf area) increased along spatial temperature gradients but did not correlate to changes in species abundances following warming. No traits correlated consistently with precipitation. Our study supports the hypothesis that spatial associations between plant traits and broad-scale climate variables can be predictive of community response to climate change, but it also suggests that not all traits with clear patterns along climate gradients will necessarily influence community response to an equal degree.},

abstract = {Each modeller who builds and analyses an individual-based model learns of course a great deal, but what has ecology as a whole learned from the individual-based models published during the last decade? Answering this question proves extremely difficult as there is no common motivation behind individual-based models. The distinction is introduced between 'pragmatic' motivation, which uses the individual-based approach as a tool without any reference to the theoretical issues which have emerged from the classical state variable approach and 'paradigmatic' motivation, which explicitly refers to theoretical ecology. A mini-review of 50 individual-based animal population models shows that the majority are driven by pragmatic motivation. Most models are very complex and special techniques to cope with this complexity during their analysis are only occasionally applied. It is suggested that in order to orient individual-based modelling more towards general theoretical issues, we need increased explicit reference to theoretical ecology and an advanced strategy for building and analysing individual-based models. To this end, a heuristic list of rules is presented which may help us to advance the practice of individual-based modelling and to learn more general lessons from individual-based modelling in the future than we have during the last decade. The main ideas behind these rules are as follows: (1) Individual-based models usually make more realistic assumptions than state variable models, but it should not be forgotten that the aim of individual-based modelling is not 'realism' but modelling. (2) The individual-based approach is a bottom-up approach which starts with the 'parts' (i.e. individuals) of a system (i.e. population) and then tries to understand how the system's properties emerge from the interaction among these parts. However, bottom-up approaches alone will never lead to theories at the systems level. State variable or top-down approaches are needed to provide an appropriate integrated view, i.e. the relevant questions at the population level.},

We examined whether species richness (SR) and taxonomic distinctness (TD) were significantly related and whether they showed similar environmental relationships in regional data sets for various groups of freshwater organisms, ranging from lake mollusks and fishes to stream diatoms and invertebrates. We found that the relationship between SR and TD varied widely, ranging from significantly negative through nonsig- nificant to significantly positive. In general, SR and TD were related to different environmental gradients, although the particular environmental variables accounting for biodiversity patterns varied among data sets and, more im- portantly, even between different data sets for the same organism groups. SR and TD can provide complementary views of the variability of biodiversity. These findings thus underline the importance of considering a set of different measures in the assessment of community-level biodiversity, as well as considering this variability when determining anthropogenic effects in freshwater ecosystems.},

As trophic relationships (i.e. who eats whom) are among the most frequent interspecific interactions, food webs serve well as system models. To better understand ecosystem dynamics, neither strictly local (focusing on individual species) nor strictly global (focusing on the whole ecosystem) approaches are adequate. This mesoscale view on network links suggests to quantify indirect interactions up to some reasonable range, and a mesoscale view on network nodes suggests to identify a small set of nodes that are in the most important network positions. We present some examples taking this mesoscale view in ecosystem modeling and use these to discuss the mesoscale perspective. For systems-based conservation management, we suggest to focus on keystone species complexes that are determined considering their indirect interaction neighborhood. This approach provides a systems-based alternative that hopefully increases the efficiency of future conservation efforts: A small set of system components are targeted in such a way that a large set of the remaining elements are benefited.},

The results of the simulations for the historical climate compared favorably to independent estimates and observations, but validation of the results was complicated by the lack of land use effects in the model. The response to increasing temperatures under both scenarios was characterized by a shift in dominance from needle-leaved to broad-leaved life-forms and by increases in vegetation productivity, especially in the relatively cool and mesic regions of the state. The simulated response to changes in precipitation were complex, involving not only the effect of changes in soil moisture on vegetation productivity, but also changes in tree–grass competition mediated by fire. Summer months were warmer and persistently dry under both scenarios, so the trends in simulated fire area under both scenarios were primarily a response to changes in vegetation biomass. Total ecosystem carbon increased under both climate scenarios, but the proportions allocated to the wood and grass carbon pools differed. The results of the simulations underscore the potentially large impact of climate change on California eco- systems, and the need for further use and development of dynamic vegetation models using various ensembles of climate change scenarios.

The two troops specialized on different habitats in spite of the fact that both of them had all habitats available and were not constrained by neighboring troops since the population density of howlers is low (7- 15 howlers/km 2 ).Troop 1 spent the majority of time in primary forest (80{\%}) followed by secondary forest (10{\%}), while troop 2 spent the majority of time in undisturbed riparian habitat (60{\%}) followed by primary forest (30{\%}). Habitat sampling indicates that neither the total number of stems, species, or families nor the diversity (Shannon index) or evenness is a good indicator for howler habitat selection. Instead the density of trees from the 12 species most commonly consumed by each troop is the most important factor. Activity and foraging patterns were not dependent upon the season as has been described for howling monkeys in forests with a more pronounced dry season at Barro Colorado Island, Panama, and La Pacifica in northwestern Costa Rica. This is likely a result of the more constant food supply at La Selva, combined with less intraspecific competition due to the low howler density. The intraspecific variability of foraging patterns and troop- specific habitat specialization observed in Alouatta palliatashould be considered in the conservation biology of primates. Primate relocation programs should include not only an ecological assessment of the release site but also a comparison of the release site with the habitat that the groups currently occupy.},

Here I describe some of the limitations of this approach and illustrate how these limitations may affect its usefulness. I do this by comparing the results of such an analysis, performed in 1979 on two populations of a perennial plant, Arisaema triphyllum, with new information about the size and structure of these same populations gathered in 1994, 15 years later. While one population changed as the model projected it would, the other behaved quite differently from the projection. Instead of increasing in size, this population decreased between 1979 and 1994. Possible shortcomings in the data and in the model include: too few plants to provide accurate transition probabilities; too few years to capture accurately the complete range of year-to-year environmental variability; and the failure of the most commonly used form of the model to account for density-dependent vital rates. In addition, the asymptotic growth rates (l) these models yield may sometimes be irrelevant and even misleading if one's primary interest is in a population's short-term prospects for survival, as is often the case in studies of sensitive species. These shortcomings may apply to many studies involving the use of projection models, and they have important implications for the value of this approach in conservation biology and species management decisions.},
annote = {ABSTRACT
2 different populations are studied. 
The problems with matrix population models is that
- the individuals sample is too small
- the period of time at which the population has been sampled is too small
- it doens't provide valuable informations about the near future
- sometimes lamda (asymptotich growth rate) is misleading
INTRODUCTION
MPM have started to be used in the 60s for animals and in the 70s for plants. 
It is hard to tell how a population will behave in the near future. This is normally what the conservationists try to do.
Also the density dependence is not taken into account. 
METHODS
Transition matrix analysis
When the matrix is multiplied by the vector a sufficient number of times, every stage class grows of the scalar lamda (asymptotic growth rate). If it's {\textgreater}1 the population grows and so on. Lamda is the eigenvalue and the matrix is its eigenvector. 

Sampling methods
The asymptotic analysis
Short-term (transient) population behaviour
RESULTS
Asymptotic analysis
Short-term (transient) population behaviour
DISCUSSION
MPM worked only for one of the two populations and the transient analysis didn't work at all.
The major problem about MPM is that it assumes that vital rates will remain the same in the future. Reasons why the author thinks that this is not the case:
1) A too small sampling size has been considered to estimate the survival probability. This is true especially for rare species. It is important to report also the confidence limits.
2) More samples should be taken. This is because it's possible then to take sthocasticity more into account. 
3) Samples should be taken for a lot of years. 
4) MPM don't take into consideration density dependent effects.
For some authors lamda is important because it provides a good esteem of the respondes to different managment strategies.
They say also that the most important thing is studying sensitivity and elasticity. But also these can be invalidated. 
If you want to compare two different populations, the environment and the density dependent effects should be really similar.
Lamda just estimates the tendence of the population growth in the future. It's possible that in the near future the population will decline and then die. It depends from the initial composition of the population. It provides an example of why 3 different populations behave in different ways even if the matrix is the same. 
The closest a population is to its stable distribution the more predictable its behaviour will be.
The studies found out that the population matrix models didn't work. This could be because
1) Three years was not enough
2) Density dependence factors
3) P has not been correctly estimated

The authors conclude saying that the researchers need to calculate vital rates better and during a longer period of time.},

We examined relationships between body size and trophic position (TP) within fish assemblages in four lowland rivers of the LowerMekong Basin in Cambodia. Stable isotope analysis (based on $\delta$15N) was used to estimate TP of common fish species in each river, and species were classified according to occupation of benthic versus pelagic habitats and major feeding guilds. Regression analysis yielded strong correlations between body size and TP among fishes from the Sesan and Sreprok rivers, but not those from the Mekong and Sekong rivers. The Mekong fish assemblage had higher average TP compared with those of other rivers. The relationship between body size and TP was positive and significantly correlated for piscivores and omnivores, but not for detritivores and insectivores. The body size-TP relationship did not differ between pelagic and benthic fishes. Body size significantly predicted TP within the orders Siluriformes and Perciformes, but not for Cypriniformes, the most species-rich and ecologically diverse order in the Lower Mekong River. We conclude that for species-rich, tropical fish assemblages with many detritivores and invertivores, body size would not be an appropriate surrogate for TP in food web models and other ecological applications.},

abstract = {Premise of the study: Seabirds often cause signifi cant changes to soil properties, and seabird-dominated systems often host unique plant communities. This study experimentally (1) examined species-specifi c responses to seabird guano gradients, (2) considered the role that differential functional traits among species play in altering plant response to guano, and (3) investigated the implications of seabird guano on range-expanding species. Methods: Using a greenhouse fertilization experiment, we examined how guano fertilization affects the growth and functional traits of four tree species dominant in the Pacific Islands: Cocos nucifera, Pisonia grandis, Scaevola sericea, and Tournefortia argentea. In these systems, seabirds are frequently found in association with three of these four species; the remaining species, C. nucifera, is a recently proliferating species commonly found in the region but rarely associated with seabirds. Key results: We determined that responses to guano addition differed significantly between species in ways that were consistent with predictions based on differing functional traits among species. Notably, we demonstrated that C. nucifera showed no growth responses to guano additions, whereas all seabird-associated plants showed strong responses. Conclusions: These results provide experimental evidence of differential species response to guano additions, suggesting that differences in species functional traits may contribute to changes in plant communities in seabird-dominated areas, with seabird- associated species garnering performance advantages in these high-nutrient environments. Among these species, results also suggest that C. nucifera may have a competitive advantage in low-nutrient environments, providing an unusual example of how a range-expanding plant species can profi t from low-nutrient environments. {\textcopyright} 2011 Botanical Society of America.},

abstract = {The positional behavior of habituated adult chimpanzees and baboons was observed for 784 hr in a year‐long study. Comparisons between species were made to establish the distinctiveness of chimpanzee positional behavior and habitat use. Brachiation (sensu stricto, i.e., hand‐over‐hand suspensory locomotion) was observed in low frequencies among chimpanzees, and its significance for chimpanzee anatomy is judged slight. Although no significant differences were found between sympatric baboons and chimpanzees in the proportion of time spent in the terminal branches, or in the mean diameter of weight‐bearing strata, chimpanzees exhibited evidence of a terminal branch adaptation in that they, unlike baboons, used postures among smaller supporting strata different from those used among larger supports. Among chimpanzees, unimanual arm‐hanging was most common among the smallest strata and was associated with smaller mean and median support diameter than other postures. Unimanual arm‐hanging was the only common behavior among chimpanzees that usually involved complete abduction of the humerus. A number of behaviors often subsumed under the label “quadrumanous climbing” were distinguished in this study. Compared to baboons and other cercopithecoids, chimpanzees did not show increased frequencies of large‐stratum vertical climbing, and their vertical climbing did not involve significant humeral abduction. Arm‐hanging (i.e., unimanual suspension) and vertical climbing distinguish chimpanzee positional behavior from that of monkeys. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1992 Wiley‐Liss, Inc., A Wiley Company},

abstract = {Fresh waters are particularly vulnerable to climate change because (i) many species within these fragmented habitats have limited abilities to disperse as the environment changes; (ii) water temperature and availability are climate-dependent; and (iii) many systems are already exposed to numerous anthropogenic stressors. Most climate change studies to date have focused on individuals or species populations, rather than the higher levels of organization (i.e. communities, food webs, ecosystems). We propose that an understanding of the connections between these different levels, which are all ultimately based on individuals, can help to develop a more coherent theoretical framework based on metabolic scaling, foraging theory and ecological stoichiometry, to predict the ecological consequences of climate change. For instance, individual basal metabolic rate scales with body size (which also constrains food web structure and dynamics) and temperature (which determines many ecosystem processes and key aspects of foraging behaviour). In addition, increasing atmospheric CO2 is predicted to alter molar CNP ratios of detrital inputs, which could lead to profound shifts in the stoichiometry of elemental fluxes between consumers and resources at the base of the food web. The different components of climate change (e.g. temperature, hydrology and atmospheric composition) not only affect multiple levels of biological organization, but they may also interact with the many other stressors to which fresh waters are exposed, and future research needs to address these potentially important synergies. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society.},

Aggregate data series refers to a set of values, each of which is averaged or otherwise aggregated across respondents. The motivating problem is the comparison of aggregate proximity matrices, such as those obtained from pile sort exercises. The standard approach to this problem uses the nonparametric, permutation-based quadratic assignment program (QAP) technique. However, the null distribution that QAP is based on is inappropriate for comparing subsamples of a data set and may lead to misleading conclusions. The new method can yield different results than QAP, results more in line with researchers' intuition. Furthermore, the method can be applied to a variety of data types beyond those appropriate for QAP. {\textcopyright} 2002, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Global change has created a severe biodiversity crisis. Species are driven extinct at an increasing rate, and this has the potential to cause further coextinction cascades. The rate and shape of these coextinction cascades depend very much on the structure of the networks of interactions across species. Understanding network structure and how it relates to network disassembly, therefore, is a priority for system-level conservation biology. This process of network collapse may indeed be related to the process of network build-up, although very little is known about both processes and even less about their relationship. Here we review recent work that provides some preliminary answers to these questions. First, we focus on network assembly by emphasizing temporal processes at the species level, as well as the structural building blocks of complex ecological networks. Second, we focus on network disassembly as a consequence of species extinctions or habitat loss. We conclude by emphasizing some general rules of thumb that can help in building a comprehensive framework to understand the responses of ecological networks to global change. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society.},

Pelage coloration of fetuses and neonates were described for P. melalophos and P. femoralis. Based on this study, three species-P thomasi, R melalophos, and P. femoralis-are recognized. Using field data that have been gathered since 1981, the distribution of these three species has been mapped. The resultant map reveals that no sympatry is known and that rivers form the interspecific boundaries. However, rivers apparently are not barriers to the dispersal of species in this group. Instead, distributions appear to be limited ecologically, by competitive exclusion. Historically, it appears that the ancestral stock initially dispersed throughout this area, then the P. melalophos stock split from the P thomasi-P. femoralis stock, the P. thomasi stock split from the P. femoralis stock, and, finally, the P. femoralis stock dispersed to eastern Sumatera. It appears unlikely that the centrifugal speciation hypothesis based on the principle of metachromism applies to deployment of the P. melalophos group.},

Predictions routinely focus on the direct effects of climate change on individual species, yet interactions between species can strongly influence how climate change affects organisms at every scale by altering their individual fitness, geographic ranges and the structure and dynamics of their community. Failure to incorporate these interactions limits the ability to predict responses of species to climate change. We propose a framework based on ideas from global-change biology, community ecology, and invasion biology that uses community modules to assess how species interactions shape responses to climate change. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

{\textperiodcentered}      The size of the ecological network. But not all the times.

abstract = {The success of a biological invasion is context dependent, and yet two key concepts—the invasiveness of species and the invasibility of recipient ecosystems—are often defined and considered separately. We propose a framework that can elucidate the complex relationship between invasibility and invasiveness. It is based on trait-mediated interactions between species and depicts the response of an ecological network to the intrusion of an alien species, drawing on the concept of community saturation. Here, invasiveness of an introduced species with a particular trait is measured by its per capita population growth rate when the initial propagule pressure of the introduced species is very low. The invasibility of the recipient habitat or ecosystem is dependent on the structure of the resident ecological network and is defined as the total width of an opportunity niche in the trait space susceptible to invasion. Invasibility is thus a measure of network instability. We also correlate invasibility with the asymptotic stability of resident ecological network, measured by the leading eigenvalue of the interaction matrix that depicts trait-based interaction intensity multiplied by encounter rate (a pairwise product of propagule pressure of all members in a community). We further examine the relationship between invasibility and network architecture, including network connectance, nestedness and modularity. We exemplify this framework with a trait-based assembly model under perturbations in ways to emulate fluctuating resources and random trait composition in ecological networks. The maximum invasiveness of a potential invader (greatest intrinsic population growth rate) was found to be positively correlated with invasibility of the recipient ecological network. Additionally, ecosystems with high network modularity and high ecological stability tend to exhibit high invasibility. Where quantitative data are lacking we propose using a qualitative interaction matrix of the ecological network perceived by a potential invader so that the structural network stability and invasibility can be estimated from the literature or from expert opinion. This approach links network structure, invasiveness and invasibility in the context of trait-mediated interactions, such as the invasion of insects into mutualistic and antagonistic networks.},

abstract = {It is well established that predators can scare as well as consume their prey. In many systems, the fear of being eaten causes trait-mediated cascades whose strength can rival or exceed that of more widely recognized density-mediated cascades transmitted by predators that consume their prey. Despite this progress it is only beginning to be understood how the influence of pr{\'{e}}dation risk is shaped by environmental context and whether it can exert an important influence on ecosystem-level processes. This study used a factorial mesocosm experiment that manipulated basal-resource identity (either barnacles, Semibalanus balanoides, or mussels, Mytilus edulis) to determine how resources modify the influence of predation risk, cascade strength, and the efficiency of energy transfer in two, tritrophic, rocky-shore food chains containing the predatory green crab (Carciuus maenas) and an intermediate consumer (the snail, Nucella lapillus). The effect of predation risk and the strength of trait-mediated cascades (both in absolute and relative terms) were much stronger in the barnacle than in the mussel food chain. Moreover, predation risk strongly diminished the efficiency of energy transfer in the barnacle food chain but had no significant effect in the mussel food chain. The influence of resource identity on indirect-effect strength and energy transfer was likely caused by differences in how each resource shapes the degree of risk perceived by prey. We suggest that our understanding of the connection between trophic dynamics and ecosystem functioning will improve considerably once the effects of predation risk on individual behavior and physiology are considered. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Introduction What is it that makes a biological community stable? What gives it the ability to resist disturbances, or the ability to adapt and change gradually and not fall apart at the smallest perturbation? Do species interact in such a way that these “webs” of interactions make stable organizations? And are the stabilizing properties in the interactions among species related to general properties of community or ecosystem structure? One of the classic ideas in ecology is that complex communities or ecosystems are more stable, in an unspecified sense, than simple ones (Elton, 1927; McArthur, 1955; Odum, 1971). This is often illustrated by the example of a well-developed tropical rainforest and a monoculture in an arable field. The rainforest, a highly diverse system, with small fluctuations in population abundances and steady nutrient cycles, is regarded as a stable system, while the relatively simple agricultural system does not have that many feedback mechanisms (Levins, 1974) and is very susceptible to, for example, pest outbreaks or adverse weather conditions. In contrast is the idea that complexity in communities leads to instability (Levins, 1968; Garner and Ashby, 1970; May, 1972). This idea originates from the studies of mathematical models that represent dynamic equilibria of randomly interacting species. The larger the number of species or the higher the proportion of realized interactions (connectance) in a system, the less likely the system is to return to the equilibrium state after a small perturbation from equilibrium. More than anything, these examples make clear that when talking about community stability we may think of many aspects of systems, types of disturbance, and stability (Grimm and Wissel, 1997). Stability may be associated with such concepts as constancy, the ability to resist disturbances, the ability to return to an equilibrium after disturbance, or the speed with which the system returns to equilibrium. In this chapter we will use the traditional mathematical framework, that of Jacobian “community” matrices, linearizations (around the equilibrium) of classic population dynamical models (May, 1973).},

abstract = {The rigorous demonstration of truly stable alternate community states is elusive in marine ecosystems and might remain so for some time. Examples of marine community states that have shifted are nevertheless increasingly conspicuous. The growing concern over these altered community states is often related to questions of persistence and reversibility, especially when these shifted states are considered to be degraded. I used empirically-based trophic models and direct empirical field studies to explore the potential of particular hypothesized mechanisms to generate and maintain alternate community states in four marine ecosystems: a Gal{\'{a}}pagos rocky reef, Prince William Sound, Alaska, the West Florida Continental Shelf, and coral reefs of the Spermonde Archipelago or Southwest Sulawesi, Indonesia. Construction and analysis of an Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) model of a Gal{\'{a}}pagos rocky reef indicated that the unsustainable fishery targeting the holothurian Stichopus fuscus can, by itself, trigger the replacement of previously diverse reef platform communities with Aiptasia sp. anemone barrens. Construction and analysis of a Prince William Sound, Alaska EwE model indicated that severe disturbances such as the Exxon Valdez oil spill can shift a marine biotic community to an alternate state that persists in a stable manner for decades, and that the character of such disturbances, in terms of their breadth and community-level life-history signatures, might strongly influence whether a community shifts to an alternate state. In addition, a search for keystone species provided a whole-system approach to identifying species or functional groups whose depletion or removal might have the most severe consequences for community structure, and the most potential for mediating shifts. Construction and analysis of a West Florida Shelf EwE model indicated that increased sea floor shading by coastal phytoplankton (i.e., resulting from nutrient runoff pollution) can cause broad shifts in this continental shelf community by shading benthic primary producers, which support much of the overall shelf community. An empirical field study of monsoons and runoff in Southwest Sulawesi, Indonesia indicates some of the mechanisms involved in shifting tropical reefs from coral-dominated to algae-dominated systems. These contributions feature some newly emerging approaches for gaining insights into marine communities and for developing hypotheses that can be more rigorously evaluated in the future. None of these examples, however, are comprehensive or strictly falsificationist by themselves. The continued integration of these emerging community/ecosystem modeling approaches with direct empirical studies should vastly increase the potential for distinguishing the relative roles of natural and anthropogenic forces in shaping marine communities. The goal of the first steps described here was to identify particular mechanisms in each example that have the potential to generate or maintain community shifts.},

abstract = {Most traditional "biodiversity" indices have an uncertain ecological interpretation, unfavourable sampling properties, and excessive data requirements. A new index of taxonomic distinctness (the average evolutionary distance between species in an assemblage) has many advantages over traditional measures, bur its ecological interpretation remains unclear. We used published behavioural species data in conjunction with bird atlas data to quantify simple functional metrics (the fraction of species engaged in non-competitive interactions, and the average between-species disparity in habitat preferences) for breeding-bird assemblages in Europe and North America. We then analysed correlations of functional metrics with taxonomic distinctness and species richness, respectively. All functional metrics had weak, positive correlations with species richness. In contrast, correlations between functional metrics and taxonomic distinctness ranged from slightly negative to strongly positive, depending on the relative habitat heterogeneity, and on the resource involved in the between-species interaction. Strong positive correlations between taxonomic distinctness and the fraction of interactive species occurred for resources with few producer species per consumer species, and we suggest that taxonomic distinctness is consistently correlated with conservation worth. With its favourable sampling properties and data requirements, this taxonomic distinctness measure is a promising tool for biodiversity research and for environmental monitoring and management.},

abstract = {Biotic interactions drive key ecological and evolutionary processes and mediate ecosystem responses to climate change. The direction, frequency, and intensity of biotic interactions can in turn be altered by climate change. Understanding the complex interplay between climate and biotic interactions is thus essential for fully anticipating how ecosystems will respond to the fast rates of current warming, which are unprecedented since the end of the last glacial period. We highlight episodes of climate change that have disrupted ecosystems and trophic interactions over time scales ranging from years to millennia by changing species' relative abundances and geographic ranges, causing extinctions, and creating transient and novel communities dominated by generalist species and interactions. These patterns emerge repeatedly across disparate temporal and spatial scales, suggesting the possibility of similar underlying processes. Based on these findings, we identify knowledge gaps and fruitful areas for research that will further our understanding of the effects of climate change on ecosystems.},

We propose a complementary approach, applicable in any domain with object-to-object relationships, that measures similarity of the structural context in which objects occur, based on their relationships with other objects. Effectively, we compute a measure that says "two objects are similar if they are related to similar objects." This general similarity measure, called SimRank, is based on a simple and intuitive graph-theoretic model. For a given domain, SimRank can be combined with other domain-specific similarity measures. We suggest techniques for efficient computation of SimRank scores, and provide experimental results on two application domains showing the computational feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.},

abstract = {1. Introduction. If n objects are ranked by m persons according to some quality of the objects there arises the problem: does the set of m rankings of n show any evidence of community of judgment among the m individuals? For example, if a number of pieces of poetry are ranked by students in order of preference, do the rankings support the supposition that the students have poetical tastes in common, and if so is there any strong degree of unanimity or only a faint degree? The problem in its full generality permits of no assumption about the nature of the quality according to which the objects are ranked, other than that ranking is possible. No hypothesis is made that the quality is measurable, still less that there is some underlying frequency distribution to the quantiles of which the rankings correspond. The quality is to be thought of as linear in the sense that any two objects possessing it are either coincident or may be put in the relation "before and after." A metric may, of course, be imposed on this linear space by convention; but the relationship between objects is invariant under any transformation which stretches the scale of measurement. In particular, it is not a condition of the problem that the ranking shall be based on a distri- bution according to a normal variate.},

abstract = {Humans are altering the composition of biological communities through a variety of activities that increase rates of species invasions and species extinctions, at all scales, from local to global. These changes in components of the Earth's biodiversity cause concern for ethical and aesthetic reasons, but they also have a strong potential to alter ecosystem properties and the goods and services they provide to humanity. Ecological experiments, observations, and theoretical developments show that ecosystem properties depend greatly on biodiversity in terms of the functional characteristics of organisms present in the ecosystem and the distribution and abundance of those organisms over space and time. Species effects act in concert with the effects of climate, resource availability, and disturbance regimes in influencing ecosystem properties. Human activities can modify all of the above factors; here we focus on modification of these biotic controls. The scientific community has come to a broad consensus on many aspects of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, including many points relevant to management of ecosystems. Further progress will require integration of knowledge about biotic and abiotic controls on ecosystem properties, how ecological communities are structured, and the forces driving species extinctions and invasions. To strengthen links to policy and management, we also need to integrate our ecological knowledge with understanding of the social and economic constraints of potential management practices. Understanding this complexity, while taking strong steps to minimize current losses of species, is necessary for responsible management of Earth's ecosystems and the diverse biota they contain. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain of the following conclusions: 1)Species' functional characteristics strongly influence ecosystem properties. Functional characteristics operate in a variety of contexts, including effects of dominant species, keystone species', ecological engineers, and interactions among species (e.g., competition, facilitation, mutualism, disease, and predation). Relative abundance alone is not always a good predictor of the ecosystem-level importance of a species, as even relatively rare species (e.g., a keystone predator) can strongly influence pathways of energy and material flows. 2) Alteration of biota in ecosystems via species invasions and extinctions caused by human activities has altered ecosystem goods and services in many well-documented cases. Many of these changes are difficult, expensive, or impossible to reverse or fix with technological solutions. 3) The effects of species loss or changes in composition, and the mechanisms by which the effects manifest themselves, can differ among ecosystem properties, ecosystem types, and pathways of potential community change. 4) Some ecosystem properties are initially insensitive to species loss because (a) ecosystems may have multiple species that carry out similar functional roles, (b) some species may contribute relatively little to ecosystem properties, or (c) properties may be primarily controlled by abiotic environmental conditions. 5) More species are needed to insure a stable supply of ecosystem goods and services as spatial and temporal variability increases, which typically occurs as longer time periods and larger areas are considered. We have high confidence in the following conclusions: 1) Certain combinations of species are complementary in their patterns of resource use and can increase average rates of productivity and nutrient retention. At the same time, environmental conditions can influence the importance of complementarity in structuring communities. Identification of which and how many species act in a complementary way in complex communities is just beginning. 2) Susceptibility to invasion by exotic species is strongly influenced by species composition and, under similar environmental conditions, generally decreases with increasing species richness. However, several other factors, such as propagule pressure, disturbance regime, and resource availability also strongly influence invasion success and often override effects of species richness in comparisons across different sites or ecosystems. 3) Having a range of species that respond differently to different environmental perturbations can stabilize ecosystem process rates in response to disturbances and variation in abiotic conditions. Using practices that maintain a diversity of organisms of different functional effect and functional response types will help preserve a range of management options. Uncertainties remain and further research is necessary in the following areas: 1) Further resolution of the relationships among taxonomic diversity, functional diversity, and community structure is important for identifying mechanisms of biodiversity effects. 2) Multiple trophic levels are common to ecosystems but have been understudied in biodiversity/ecosystem functioning research. The response of ecosystem properties to varying composition and diversity of consumer organisms is much more complex than responses seen in experiments that vary only the diversity of primary producers. 3) Theoretical work on stability has outpaced experimental, work, especially field research. We need long-term experiments to be able to assess temporal stability, as well as experimental perturbations to assess response to and recovery from a variety of disturbances. Design and analysis of such experiments must account for several factors that covary with species diversity. 4) Because biodiversity both responds to and influences ecosystem properties, understanding the feedbacks involved is necessary to integrate results from experimental communities with patterns seen at broader scales. Likely patterns of extinction and invasion need to be linked to different drivers of global change, the forces that structure communities, and controls on ecosystem properties for the development of effective management and conservation strategies. 5) This paper focuses primarily on terrestrial systems, with some coverage of freshwater systems, because that is where most empirical and theoretical study has focused. While the fundamental principles described here should apply to marine systems, further study of that realm is necessary. Despite some uncertainties about the mechanisms and circumstances under which diversity influences ecosystem properties, incorporating diversity effects into policy and management is essential, especially in making decisions involving large temporal and spatial scales. Sacrificing those aspects of ecosystems that are difficult or impossible to reconstruct, such as diversity, simply because we are not yet certain about the extent and mechanisms by which they affect ecosystem properties, will restrict future management options even further. It is incumbent upon ecologists to communicate this need, and the values that can derive from such a perspective, to those charged with economic and policy decision-making.},

abstract = {The visible landscape is believed to affect human beings in many ways, including aesthetic appreciation and health and well-being. The aim of this paper is to analyse the range of landscapes used in environmental psychology studies, and the evidence of health effects related to viewing these landscapes. A literature review of publications linking landscapes and health effects was conducted. This reported evidence of health and well-being effects related to exposure to visual landscapes. The results of the review include an overview of the types of landscape used in the studies, the evidence on health effects, the methods and measures applied and the different groups of respondents. The analysis reveals a predominance of studies using only coarse categories of landscapes. Most landscape representations have been classed as "natural" or "urban". Few studies were found to use subcategories within these groups. Generally, the natural landscapes gave a stronger positive health effect compared to urban landscapes. Urban landscapes were found to have a less positive and in some cases negative effect on health. Three main kinds of health effects have been identified in the study; short-term recovery from stress or mental fatigue, faster physical recovery from illness and long-term overall improvement on people's health and well-being. The study provides an overview of the relationships between health and landscapes arranged in an accessible format, identifying gaps in our knowledge requiring further research. The identification of quantifiable landscape attributes that affect health is seen as an important factor in enabling future landscape design to be of benefit to human health. {\textcopyright}2007 Elsevier GmbH.

abstract = {Keystones are defined as relatively low biomass species with a structuring role in their food webs. Thus, identifying keystone species in a given ecosystem may be formulated as: (1) estimating the impact on the different elements of an ecosystem resulting from a small change to the biomass of the species to be evaluated for its 'keystoneness'; and (2) deciding on the keystoneness of a given species as a function of both the impact estimated in (1) and its own biomass. Experimental quantification of interaction strength necessarily focus on few species, and require a priori assumptions on the importance of the interactions, which can bias the identification of keystone species. Moreover, empirical measurements, although very important, are expensive and time consuming and, owing to the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of habitats, physical conditions, and densities of organisms, published results tend to be case-specific and context-dependent. Although models can only represent but a caricature of the complexity of the real world, the modelling approach can be helpful since it allows overcoming some of the difficulties mentioned. Here we present an approach for estimating the keystoneness of the functional groups (species or group of species) of food web models. Network mixed trophic impact analysis, based on Leontief's economic input-output analysis, allows to express the relative change of biomasses in the food web that would result from an infinitesimal increase of the biomass of the observed group, thus identifying its total impact. The analysis of the mixed trophic impacts presented here was applied to a suite of mass-balance models, and the results allow us to rank functional groups by their keystoneness. Overall, we concluded that the straightforward methodology proposed here and the broad use of Ecopath with Ecosim (where mixed trophic impact analysis is implemented) together give a solid empirical basis for identification of keystone functional groups. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The redistribution of life on Earth has emerged as one of the most significant biological responses to anthropogenic climate warming1-3. Despite being one of the most long-standing puzzles in ecology4, we still have little understanding of how temperature sets geographic range boundaries5. Here we show that marine and terrestrial ectotherms differ in the degree to which they fill their potential latitudinal ranges, as predicted from their thermal tolerance limits. Marine ectotherms more fully occupy the extent of latitudes tolerable within their thermal tolerance limits, and are consequently predicted to expand at their poleward range boundaries and contract at their equatorward boundaries with climate warming. In contrast, terrestrial ectotherms are excluded from the warmest regions of their latitudinal range; thus, the equatorward, or 'trailing' range boundaries, may not shift consistently towards the poles with climate warming. Using global observations of climate-induced range shifts, we test this prediction and show that in the ocean, shifts at both range boundaries have been equally responsive, whereas on land, equatorward range boundaries have lagged in response to climate warming. These results indicate that marine species' ranges conform more closely to their limits of thermal tolerance, and thus range shifts will be more predictable and coherent. However, on land, warmer range boundaries are not at equilibrium with heat tolerance. Understanding the relative contribution of factors other than temperature in controlling equatorward range limits is critical for predicting distribution changes, with implications for population and community viability. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Patterns of association and habitat use were studied on intertidal mudflats and adjacent saltworks during spring and autumn migration in 1999 on the Tavira estuary, Ria Formosa, southern Portugal. Twenty of the thirty species studied, mainly Charadriiformes, winter in and/or migrate through Tavira. The species distribution patterns were highly influenced by habitat – mostly because of the vast diversity of habitats available such as intertidal mud, mud/sand flats and saltworks – and to a lesser degree by tide and month. Migrant species, all gregarious, were the most characteristic of the saltworks during low tide. Non-tidal habitats were used as alternative foraging sites at high tide in summer, but these were also the main foraging sites used during migration periods, significantly supporting several migrant shorebird populations. Overall, this study reinforces the idea that even small estuaries, like that at Tavira, play a crucial role for considerable numbers of shorebirds during migration.},

During spring and autumn migrating birds use shores to refuel during their journey (Erwin, 1996). May and August have the highest peak of birds (Fonseca, Grade, {\&} Da Fonseca, 2004). These birds stop by in Ria Formosa from one day to one month (Fonseca, Grade, {\&} Da Fonseca, 2004).

The past centuries have witnessed the loss of many intertidal habitats because of humans: these areas are really important for different birds that forage there (Fonseca, Grade, {\&} Da Fonseca, 2004). However, some human made habitats such as the saltworks provide them a place where to forage and roost (Masero, P{\'{e}}rez-Hurtado, Castro, {\&} Arroyo, 2000). Waders have been demonstrated to make a great use out of the salinas in Ria Formosa. The bird community composition is mainly influenced by the habitat and not by the month or the tide. The variety of habitats that can be find in Ria Formosa provide different feeding opportunities to different species. 
Southern Portugal is a really important habitat in the East Atlantic flyway. It hosts a great variety of different migratory wetland species. This is mainly due to the favourable climate and the high sources of food.},

abstract = {Most of the freshwater component of the Earth's surface is composed of shallow tundra ponds. These high latitude ecosystems have been exposed to a variety of abiotic disturbances associated with recent environmental change. However, the biological significance of these changes remains poorly understood. Here, we characterize the abiotic disturbance to the shallow tundra ponds of northwest Alaska. We used historical aerial imagery to determine that up to 53{\%} of the sampled ponds have formed during the recent warmer decades (since the 1970s). We discovered that two top predator species (phantom midges of the genus Chaoborus) of the freshwater zooplankton have recently undergone range expansion, forming widespread (a scale of hundreds of km) stable tundra populations. We assessed the population persistence of these boreal predators by longitudinal sampling over 14 yr. Recent thaw ponds had significantly dissimilar zooplankton communities to communities of ponds that formed before 1950. Both predator and herbivore species differed by age of pond. Younger pond ages and warmer surface temperatures were the significant predictors of the presence of temperate Chaoborus americanus in tundra ponds. Ponds containing tundra populations of C. americanus and C. cf. flavicans were associated with recent formation (83-90{\%}). Recent ponds in river valleys appeared more important than recent ponds near roads as colonization corridors for C. americanus. Only 24{\%} of the tundra keystone predator, Heterocope septentrionalis, populations were from recent ponds. Our results suggest that climate-associated disturbance can lead to a widespread stable range expansion of boreal species despite the propinquity of older ponds with top-down control exerted by an endemic keystone predator.},

abstract = {Ria Formosa is a natural park managed partly by the Portuguese end-users of the DITTY project – Ria Formosa Natural Park authority, under “Instituto para a Conserva{\c{c}}{\~{a}}o da Natureza (ICN)”. There are many conflicting interests over the management of this important coastal area: fishing, tourism, aquaculture, salt production, harbour activities, urban development and conservation. Furthermore, several institutions, such as the Natural Park Authority, municipalities, the Portuguese Navy, just to mention a few, are involved in decision-making over several areas of the natural park. Within DITTY, several scenarios were selected among those relevant for the management of this coastal ecosystem, considering available information from the end-users, relative importance of the mentioned scenarios, modelling and time constraints.},

A too high production of bivalves grooved carpet shells (Ruditapes decussatus) decreases the water quality by increasing the ammonium and decreasing everything else (oxygen, particulate organic matter (POM), total particulate matter (TPM), Phytoplankton) (Duarte et al., 2006). It also increases the bivalves mortality probably because of less water quality and less food availability (Duarte et al., 2006).},

abstract = {1 Stage projection (Lefkovitch) matrices for 21 species of woody plants and 45 herbaceous perennials were extracted from the plant demographic literature or compiled from published data. 2 Each matrix was divided into six regions representing: 1, recruitment of seeds to the seed pool; 2, recruitment of seedlings or juveniles from current seed production; 3, clonal growth; 4, retrogression, due to plants decreasing in size or reverting in stage; 5, stasis, (survival from one year to the next in the same stage class); 6, progression to later stage classes. 3 Matrix analysis was used to calculate the finite rate of increase lambda for each population and to calculate the elasticities of each transition coefficient in the matrices. Elasticities were summed within each of the six regions of the matrix to give measures (E1 - E6, respectively) of the importance of each component of the life cycle to lambda and fitness. 4 Herbs as a group differed significantly from woody plants in most of these components. Seedling recruitment was more important in herbs than woody plants. Retrogression occurred only in herbs, particularly those with a tuber. Stasis occurred in nearly all species, but was most important in woody plants. Progression was more important than fecundity in almost all species. 5 Trade-offs among life cycle components were determined from correlation matrices of r (= In lambda) and elasticities E1 - E6 for the whole sample and for herbs and woody plants separately. As a whole, r was positively correlated with elasticities for fecundity (E1 + E2) and growth (E3 + E6) and negatively correlated with survival (E4 + E5). In clonal herbs, fecundity and clonal growth were negatively correlated. 6 The division of elasticities into three major components (growth, G = E3 + E6; fecundity, F = E1 + E2; and survival, L = E4 + E5) allowed us to construct triangular plots in G-L-F space. This was done separately for iteroparous forest herbs, iteroparous herbs from open habitats, semelparous herbs and woody plants. Each of these four groups occupied a distinct position in G-L-F space. Within woody plants, shrubs of fire-prone habitats occupied the end of the distribution with the lowest survival elasticity. 7 It is argued that the demographic approach to the classification of distinct ecological groups offers new insights into the relationship between life history and habitat.},
annote = {Silvertown et al. (1993) studied 21 species of woody plants and 45 of perennial herbaceous perennials. They divided the matrix into 6 regions considering 6 different actions: recruitment of seeds, recruitment of seedlings, clonal growth, retrogression, stasis and progression to later stages. Then they calculated the lambda and the elasticity of every plant and herb. They found out that woody plants and perennials differ for most of their traits. Then they divided the traits into three categories (Seeds and seedlings into fecundity, clonal growth and progression to later stages into growth and retrogression and stasis into survival) and studied their elasticity in relation to r.
Silvertown et al. (1993) think that this could be useful to study the relationship between life histories and habitat.
INTRO
Comparative studies are important in plant ecology because plants are shaped in similar way by similar environmental conditions. However, if the plants have different life cycle, it becomes difficult to compare them. 
We need to find a way to do it. They used Lefktovich matrices because for plants are more appropriate than Leslie's ones. 
They studied the contribution of different life traits to lambda of herbaceous plants and woody plants.
DISCUSSION
They divided population into biologically defined stages, as suggested by Vandermeer.},

abstract = {Plankton communities account for at least half of global primary production and play a key role in the global carbon cycle. Warming and acidification may alter the interaction chains in these communities from the bottom and top of the food web. Yet, the relative importance of these potentially complex interactions has not yet been quantified. Here, we examine the isolated and combined effects of warming, acidification, and reductions in phytoplankton and predator abundances in a series of factorial experiments. We find that warming directly impacts the top of the food web, but that the intermediate trophic groups are more strongly influenced by indirect effects mediated by altered top-down interactions. Direct manipulations of predator and phytoplankton abundance reveal similar strong top-down interactions following top predator decline. A meta-analysis of published experiments further supports the conclusion that warming has stronger direct impacts on the top and bottom of the food web rather than the intermediate trophic groups, with important differences between freshwater and marine plankton communities. Our results reveal that the trophic effect of warming cascading down from the top of the plankton food web is a powerful agent of global change.},

Arguments are passionate on both sides and debate has remained subjective and unresolved because experimental evidence of the ecological impacts of dog walking has been lacking. Here we show that dog walking in woodland leads to a 35{\%} reduction in bird diversity and 41{\%} reduction in abundance, both in areas where dog walking is common and where dogs are prohibited.

abstract = {The oft-repeated claim that Earth's biota is entering a sixth "mass extinction" depends on clearly demonstrating that current extinction rates are far above the "background" rates prevailing between the five previous mass extinctions. Earlier estimates of extinction rates have been criticized for using assumptions that might overestimate the severity of the extinction crisis. We assess, using extremely conservative assumptions, whether human activities are causing a mass extinction. First, we use a recent estimate of a background rate of 2 mammal extinctions per 10,000 species per 100 years (that is, 2 E/MSY), which is twice as high as widely used previous estimates. We then compare this rate with the current rate of mammal and vertebrate extinctions. The latter is conservatively low because listing a species as extinct requires meeting stringent criteria. Even under our assumptions, which would tend to minimize evidence of an incipient mass extinction, the average rate of vertebrate species loss over the last century is up to 100 times higher than the background rate. Under the 2 E/MSY background rate, the number of species that have gone extinct in the last century would have taken, depending on the vertebrate taxon, between 800 and 10,000 years to disappear. These estimates reveal an exceptionally rapid loss of biodiversity over the last few centuries, indicating that a sixth mass extinction is already under way. Averting a dramatic decay of biodiversity and the subsequent loss of ecosystem services is still possible through intensified conservation efforts, but that window of opportunity is rapidly closing.},

abstract = {Similarity among species in traits related to ecological interactions is frequently associated with common ancestry. Thus, closely related species usually interact with ecologically similar partners, which can be reinforced by diverse co-evolutionary processes. The effect of habitat fragmentation on the phylogenetic signal in interspecific interactions and correspondence between plant and animal phylogenies is, however, unknown. Here, we address to what extent phylogenetic signal and co-phylogenetic congruence of plant-animal interactions depend on habitat size and isolation by analysing the phylogenetic structure of 12 pollination webs from isolated Pampean hills. Phylogenetic signal in interspecific interactions differed among webs, being stronger for flower-visiting insects than plants. Phylogenetic signal and overall co-phylogenetic congruence increased independently with hill size and isolation. We propose that habitat fragmentation would erode the phylogenetic structure of interaction webs. A decrease in phylogenetic signal and co-phylogenetic correspondence in plant-pollinator interactions could be associated with less reliable mutualism and erratic co-evolutionary change. Copyright},

abstract = {Introduction Food-web models, which depict the trophic relationships between organisms within a community, form a powerful and versatile approach to study the relationships between community structure and ecosystem functioning. Although food-web models have recently been applied to a wide range of ecological studies (Memmott, 2009; Sanders et al., 2014), such approaches can be greatly improved by introducing high-resolution trophic information from empirical studies and experiments that realistically describe topological structure and energy flows (de Ruiter et al., 2005). Over the last decades major technological advances have been made in empirically characterizing trophic networks by describing, in detail, the connectedness and flows in food webs. Existing empirical techniques, such as stable isotope probing (SIP) (Layman et al., 2012), have been refined and new approaches have been created by combining methods, e.g., combining Raman spectroscopy or fatty acid analysis with SIP (Ruess et al., 2005a; Li et al., 2013). These empirical methods can provide insight into different aspects of food webs and together form an extensive toolbox to investigate trophic interactions. It is crucial to recognize the potential and limitations of a range of empirical approaches in order to choose the right method in the design of empirically based food-web studies. Empirically based food webs are generally classified according to the type of input information that is required. In the following lines we will provide an overview of four types of food-web model: connectedness webs, semi-quantitative webs, energy-flow webs, and functional webs. Paine (1980) introduced three of those webs, which are widely accepted and applied in food-web studies across ecosystems. We propose to add a fourth type of empirically based food web, the semi-quantitative web. All of these food webs have the same basic structure, but the conceptual webs differ in the type of trophic information they describe and represent (Figure 16.1). Connectedness webs (Figure 16.1a) define the basic structure of a food web by describing the food-web connections per se.},

abstract = {In ecosystems, a single extinction event can give rise to multiple 'secondary' extinctions. Conservation effort would benefit from tools that help forecast the consequences of species removal. One such tool is the dominator tree, a graph-theoretic algorithm that when applied to food webs unfolds their complex architecture, yielding a simpler topology made of linear pathways that are essential for energy delivery. Each species along these chains is responsible for passing energy to the taxa that follow it and, as such, it is indispensable for their survival. To assess the predictive potential of the dominator tree, we compare its predictions with the effects that followed the collapse of the capelin (Mallotus villosus) in the Barents Sea ecosystem. To this end, we first compiled a food web for this ecosystem, then we built the corresponding dominator tree and, finally, we observed whether model predictions matched the empirical observations. This analysis shows the potential and the drawbacks of the dominator trees as a tool for understanding the causes and consequences of extinctions in food webs. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Species that are strong interactors play disproportionately important roles in the dynamics of natural ecosystems. It has been proposed that their presence is necessary for positively shaping the structure and functioning of ecosystems. We evaluated this hypothesis using the case of the world's largest parrotfish (Bolbometopon muricatum), a globally imperiled species. We used direct observation, animal tracking, and computer simulations to examine the diverse routes through which B. muricatum affects the diversity, dispersal, relative abundance, and survival of the corals that comprise the foundation of reef ecosystems. Our results suggest that this species can influence reef building corals in both positive and negative ways. Field observation and simulation outputs indicated that B. muricatum reduced the abundance of macroalgae that can outcompete corals, but they also feed directly on corals, decreasing coral abundance, diversity, and colony size. B. muricatum appeared to facilitate coral advancement by mechanically dispersing coral fragments and opening up bare space for coral settlement, but they also damaged adult corals and remobilized a large volume of potentially stressful carbonate sediment. The impacts this species has on reefs appears to be regulated in part by its abundance-the effects of B. muricatum were more intense in simulation scenarios populated with high densities of these fish. Observations conducted in regions with high and low predator (e.g., sharks) abundance generated results that are consistent with the hypothesis that these predators of B. muricatum may play a role in governing their abundance; thus, predation may modulate the intensity of the effects they have on reef dynamics. Overall our results illustrate that functionally unique and threatened species may not have universally positive impacts on ecosystems and that it may be necessary for environmental managers to consider the diverse effects of such species and the forces that mediate the strength of their influence.},

abstract = {Habitat characteristics represent the matrix for the evolution of morphological, physiological and behavioural adaptations and life history traits of animals. These include bottom-up factors (such as distribution and abundance of food) and top-down constraints (such as protection from predators). The role of different habitat components in the survival and reproduction of individuals is of prime interest and is relevant for evolutionary understanding as well as for primate conservation. So far, this has been studied by linking habitat characteristics with phenotypic traits of animals, assuming that these traits represent adaptation to a given habitat constraint. However, we should bear in mind that the characteristics we observe today may represent adaptations to constraints that acted in the past (the Epaminondas effect, named after the little boy who always did the right thing for the previous situation; or, in evolutionary terminology: animals are tracking fitness optima by trying to climb the sides of shifting adaptive peaks, Cody, 1974). However, testing hypotheses based on these ‘ghosts of past constraints' has so far been impossible.
The present chapter focuses on the description of the vegetation of forest habitats as the biotic matrix for the evolution of life history traits. References are to textbooks or publications that illustrate applications of the methods and do not always refer to the original work.},

The entrance channel to the Lakes was an important feeding site. Numbers feeding there increased on the flood tide and decreased on the ebb tide. Their dive rates followed the same pattern, suggesting they depended on shoals of juvenile fish entering the estuary during high tide. The number feeding varied from day to day, and dive rates were positively correlated with numbers, suggesting that the abundance of juvenile fish entering the channel also varied from day to day. There was no evidence that breeding success or number of breeding pairs were adversely affected by the 1995 mass mortalities of pilchard in the area. However, breeding success was reduced significantly in 1999 and 2000 following the 1998/1999 pilchard mortality. The 1995 mortality affected mainly larger size classes of pilchard, whereas the 1998/1999 mortality also affected younger age classes. This difference may explain why little terns seemed only to be adversely affected by the second mortality event.},

abstract = {Much ecological research aims to explain how climate impacts biodiversity and ecosystem-level processes through functional traits that link environment with individual performance. However, the specific climatic drivers of functional diversity across space and time remain unclear due largely to limitations in the availability of paired trait and climate data. We compile and analyze a global forest dataset using a method based on abundance-weighted trait moments to assess how climate influences the shapes of whole-community trait distributions. Our approach combines abundance-weighted metrics with diverse climate factors to produce a comprehensive catalog of trait–climate relationships that differ dramatically—27{\%} of significant results change in sign and 71{\%} disagree on sign, significance, or both—from traditional species-weighted methods. We find that (i) functional diversity generally declines with increasing latitude and elevation, (ii) temperature variability and vapor pressure are the strongest drivers of geographic shifts in functional composition and ecological strategies, and (iii) functional composition may currently be shifting over time due to rapid climate warming. Our analysis demonstrates that climate strongly governs functional diversity and provides essential information needed to predict how biodiversity and ecosystem function will respond to climate change.},

abstract = {A key factor for estimates of assimilation of resources and trophic position based on stable isotope data is the trophic discrimination factor (TDF). TDFs are assumed based on literature reviews, but may vary depending on a variety of factors, including the type of diet. We analyzed effects of alternative TDFs on estimates of assimilated resources and trophic positions for an omnivorous fish, Jenynsia multidentata, that reveals dietary variation among locations across a salinity gradient of a coastal lagoon in southern Brazil. We also compared estimates of foods ingested vs. foods assimilated. Food assimilation was estimated using carbon ($\delta$13C) and nitrogen ($\delta$15N) stable isotope ratios of food sources and consumer muscle tissue and an isotopic mixing model (SIAR); consumer trophic position (TP) was estimated from consumer and production source $\delta$15N values. Diet was estimated using an index of relative importance based on frequency of occurrence and volumetric and numeric proportions of food items from stomach contents. The effect of variation in TDF on food assimilation and TP was tested using three alternative TDFs reported in review papers. We then created a new method that used food source-specific TDFs (reported separately for herbivores and carnivores) weighted in proportion to estimated assimilation of resources according to mixing model estimates to estimate TP (hereafter TPWAR). We found that plant material was not assimilated in a proportion similar to its importance in the diet of fish at a freshwater site, and the new method yielded best assimilation estimates. Animal material made greatest contributions to fish biomass irrespective of TDFs used in the mixing model. The new method produced TP estimates consistent with differences in estimated food assimilation along the salinity gradient. Our findings support the idea that food source-specific TDFs should be used in trophic studies of omnivores, since the method improved our ability to estimate trophic position and resource assimilation, two important ecological indicators.},

We predicted that these sympatric species would partition their habitat into 2 broadly defined habitat types: complex vegetated habitats and sparsely vegetated sand flats. We sampled populations using underwater visual census techniques over landscape (100s to 1000s m) and microhabitat scales ({\textless}1 m). Over landscape scales, we estimated abundance and quantified habitat associations using generalized linear models. Over microhabitat scales, we tested for holdfast (attachment site) preferences using selection indices. Both species were patchy in distribution, but H. guttulatus mean density (0.073 ind. m super(-2)) was one order of magnitude greater than that of H. hippocampus (0.007 ind. m super(-2)). At a landscape scale, H. guttulatus abundance was positively correlated with an index of habitat complexity, the percentage of substrate covered by flora and sessile fauna. Conversely, H. hippocampus used more open and less speciose habitats that were subjected to greater oceanic influences. At microhabitat scales, both species significantly preferred grasping holdfasts over barren surfaces, but the species differed in holdfast preferences: H. guttulatus grasped all prospective holdfast types with equal probability while H. hippocampus significantly avoided both fauna and flora that formed large colonies or tracts of dense vegetation. Patterns in habitat use were consistent with differences in morphology and foraging strategy. Despite similar life histories, these sympatric species may respond differently to disturbances that modify habitat structure and complexity over landscape or microhabitat scales.},

abstract = {The robustness of ecosystems to species losses is a central question in ecology, given the current pace of extinctions and the many species threatened by human impacts, including habitat destruction and climate change. Robustness from the perspective of secondary extinctions has been addressed in the context of food webs to consider the complex network of species interactions that underlie responses to perturbations. In-silico removal experiments have examined the structural properties of food webs that enhance or hamper the robustness of ecosystems to species losses, with a focus on the role of hubs, the most connected species. Here we take a different approach and focus on the role of the connections themselves. We show that trophic links can be divided into functional and redundant based on their contribution to robustness. The analysis of empirical webs shows that hubs are not necessarily the most important species as they may hold many redundant links. Furthermore, the fraction of functional connections is high and constant across systems regardless of size and interconnectedness. The main consequence of this scaling pattern is that ecosystem robustness can be considerably reduced by species extinctions even when these do not result in any secondary extinctions. This introduces the possibility of tipping points in the collapse of ecosystems.},

Another problem is the scarcity of their quantitative description. In this paper, we propose an index for characterizing keystone species reflecting their role in food web flow networks. We present some calculations for characterizing the role of keystones in weighted webs and discuss some problems of food web dynamics. Our keystone index refers well to keystones only if trophic interactions are of prime importance in a community. We further analyse the relationship between keystone species and the reliability of network flow Keystones make network flow less reliable.

It offers a number of plausible poverty measures, each with different assumptions regarding these key issues, and shows how these insights can be used to construct a forward-looking measure of vulnerability. The chapter applies a number of these measures to data from rural Ethiopia, and shows that while correlations are high, there would still be considerable differences in ranking households by poverty according to different measures, especially those that have different views on the role of compensation},

A 2-year manipulative experiment used a series of stream mesocosms to test the effect of recurrent drought disturbance on the composition and secondary production of macroinvertebrate consumer assemblages and functional groups. On average, secondary production in drought-disturbed communities (mean 4.5gm-2yr-1) was less than half of that that in controls (mean 10.4gm-2yr-1). The effects of the drought differed among functional feeding groups, with substantial declines for detritivore shredders (by 69{\%}) and engulfing predators (by 94{\%}). Contrasting responses were evident among taxa within most functional feeding groups, ranging from extirpation to irruptions in the case of several small midge larvae, but production of most species was suppressed. Taxon-specific responses were related to body mass and voltinism. The ratio of production to biomass (community P/B) increased under drought, reflecting a shift in production from large long-lived taxa to smaller taxa with faster life cycles. This research provides some of the first experimental evidence of the profound effects that droughts can have on both the structure and functioning of aquatic ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The management of tropical forest in timber concessions has been proposed as a solution to prevent further biodiversity loss. The effectiveness of this strategy will likely depend on species-specific, population-level responses to logging. We conducted a survey (749 line transects over 3450 km) in logging concessions (1.2 million ha) in the northern Republic of Congo to examine the impact of logging on large mammal populations, including endangered species such as the elephant (Loxodonta africana), gorilla (Gorilla gorilla), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes), and bongo (Tragelaphus eurycerus). When we estimated species abundance without consideration of transect characteristics, species abundances in logged and unlogged forests were not different for most species. When we modeled the data with a hurdle model approach, however, analyzing species presence and conditional abundance separately with generalized additive models and then combining them to calculate the mean species abundance, species abundance varied strongly depending on transect characteristics. The mean species abundance was often related to the distance to unlogged forest, which suggests that intact forest serves as source habitat for several species. The mean species abundance responded nonlinearly to logging history, changing over 30 years as the forest recovered from logging. Finally the distance away from roads, natural forest clearings, and villages also determined the abundance of mammals. Our results suggest that logged forest can extend the conservation estate for many of Central Africa's most threatened species if managed appropriately. In addition to limiting hunting, logging concessions must be large, contain patches of unlogged forest, and include forest with different logging histories.},

In this paper, we draw on the literature and our own experiences working in the environmental sciences to provide an accessible resource for ECRs seeking to achieve policy impact in their chosen field. First, we describe key concepts in public policy to provide sufficient background for the non-expert. Next, we articulate a number of practical steps and tools that can help ECRs to identify and enhance the policy relevance of their research, better understand the policy world in practice and identify a range of pathways to achieving impact. Finally, we draw on our personal experiences to highlight some of the key individual characteristics and values that are needed to operate more effectively at the interface of science, policy and practice. Our hope is that the information and tools provided here can help to empower ECRs to create their own pathways to impact that best suit their individual goals, circumstances, interests and strengths.},

Different metrics are used to assess the stability of ecological systems, and the choice of one metric over another may result in conflicting conclusions. Although each of the multitude of metrics is useful for answering a specific question about stability, the relationship among metrics is poorly understood. Such lack of understanding prevents scientists from developing a unified concept of stability. Instead, by investigating these relationships we can unveil how many dimensions of stability there are (i.e., in how many independent components stability metrics can be grouped), which should help build a more comprehensive concept of stability. Here we simultaneously measured 27 stability metrics frequently used in ecological studies. Our approach is based on dynamical simulations of multispecies trophic communities under different perturbation scenarios. Mapping the relationships between the metrics revealed that they can be lumped into 3 main groups of relatively independent stability components: early response to pulse, sensitivities to press, and distance to threshold. Selecting metrics from each of these groups allows a more accurate and comprehensive quantification of the overall stability of ecological communities. These results contribute to improving our understanding and assessment of stability in ecological communities.},

To achieve this, biodiversity has to be measured, biodiversity goals have to be set and methods for implementing those goals have to be applied. Each of these steps is discussed.

Each of these has different strengths and weaknesses, which are described and evaluated. In real-world priority setting, some combination of these is usually employed. While a desirable goal might be to sample all of biodiversity from genotypes to ecosystems, an achievable goal is to represent, at some agreed level, each of the biodiversity features chosen as surrogates. Explicit systematic procedures for implementing such a goal are described. These procedures use complementarity, a measure of the contribution each area in a region makes to the conservation goal, to estimate irreplaceability and flexibility, measures of the extent to which areas can be substituted for one another in order to take competing land uses into account. Persistence and vulnerability, which also play an important role in the priority setting process, are discussed briefly.},

We test whether environmental dissimilarity predicts biotic turnover spatially and temporally across an array of environmental variables and spatial scales using recently observed climate changes as a pseudo-experimental opportunity. Location Canada. Methods We used an extensive database of observation records of 282 Canadian butterfly species collected between 1900 and 2010 to characterize spatial and temporal turnover based on Jaccard indices. We compare relationships between spatial turnover and differences in an array of relevant environmental conditions, including aspects of temperature, precipitation, elevation, primary productivity and land cover. Measurements were taken within 100-, 200- and 400-km grid cells, respectively. We tested the relative importance of each variable in predicting spatial turnover using bootstrap analysis. Finally, we tested for effects of temperature and precipitation change on temporal turnover, including distinctly accounting for turnover under individual species' potential dispersal limitations. Results Temperature differences between areas correlate with spatial turnover in butterfly assemblages, independently of distance, sampling differences or the spatial resolution of the analysis. Increasing temperatures are positively related to biotic turnover within quadrats through time. Limitations on species dispersal may cause observed biotic turnover to be lower than expected given the magnitude of temperature changes through time. Main conclusions Temperature differences can account for spatial trends in biotic dissimilarity and turnover through time in areas where climate is changing. Butterfly communities are changing quickly in some areas, probably reflecting the dispersal capacities of individual species. However, turnover is lower through time than expected in many areas, suggesting that further work is needed to understand the factors that limit dispersal across broad regions. Our results illustrate the large-scale effects of climate change on biodiversity in areas with strong environmental gradients.},

No existing biodiversity–ecosystem function study to date has simultaneously incorporated information on species traits, network topology, and extinction across multiple trophic levels, while all three factors are independently understood as critical drivers of post-extinction network structure and function. We fill this gap by comparing the functional consequences of simulated species loss both within (monotrophic) and across (bitrophic) trophic levels, in an ecological interaction network estimated from spatially explicit field data on tropical fecal detritus producer and consumers (mammals and dung beetles). We simulated trait-ordered beetle and mammal extinction separately (monotrophic extinction) and the coextinction of beetles following mammal loss (bitrophic extinction), according to network structure. We also compared the diversity effects of bitrophic extinction models using a standard monotrophic function (the daily production or consumption of fecal detritus) and a unique bitrophic functional metric (the proportion of daily detritus production that is consumed). We found similar mono- and bitrophic diversity effects, regardless of which species traits were used to drive extinctions, yet divergent predictions when different measures of function were used. The inclusion of information on network structure had little apparent effect on the qualitative relationship between diversity and function. These results contribute to our growing understanding of the functional consequences of biodiversity from real systems and underscore the importance of species traits and realistic functional metrics to assessments of the ecosystem impacts of network degradation through species loss.},

abstract = {This study investigated the extent to which aquatic plant and macroinvertebrate assemblages in small outdoor microcosms (cylinders 1.25-m diameter × 1.25 m deep) resembled assemblages found in natural ponds in Britain. Comparisons were made in terms of community structure, species richness, and numbers of uncommon species. Multivariate analysis indicated that, although the microcosms had no exact natural analogues, their plant and animal assemblages were most like those of deep, circumneutral ponds. Unlike natural ponds, the microcosms supported relatively species-poor invertebrate assemblages, lacking uncommon species. Among individual taxa, microcosms supported similar numbers of species of Gastropoda, Isopoda, Amphipoda, and Odonata as natural ponds but significantly fewer Coleoptera, Hemiptera, and Trichoptera species. This was most likely due to the absence of a shallow littoral area in the microcosms. Because of their vertical sides, the microcosms supported no marginal wetland plants, but submerged and floating-leaved plant assemblages were similar in community type and species richness to natural ponds. Refinements to microcosm and mesocosm designs are identified that would enable experimental systems to more closely replicate the assemblages found in natural ponds. In particular, the incorporation of natural margins would be likely to lead to experimental communities that were closer analogues of natural ponds.},

abstract = {1. The biomass and species richness of macrophytes and invertebrates in artificial ponds at two sites in southern Sweden (twenty-one ponds at each site) were investigated. Alkalinity was high at one site (H ponds) and low at the other site (L ponds). The ponds chosen had different densities of signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus), with mean crayfish abundance (estimated by trapping and expressed as catch per unit effort) significantly higher in the L ponds (10.7) than in the H ponds (4.9). Macrophytes, invertebrates, the amount of periphyton on stones and the organic content of the sediment were determined in each pond. 2. Macrophyte biomass, cover and species richness declined with increasing crayfish density. Macrophyte species composition differed between ponds and was related to crayfish abundance. 3. The total biomass of invertebrates and the biomass of herbivorous/detritivorous invertebrates declined with increasing crayfish abundance, but the biomass of predatory invertebrates declined only in the L ponds. The relative biomass of Gastropoda and Odonata declined in ponds where crayfish were abundant. In ponds where crayfish were abundant the invertebrate fauna was dominated by sediment-dwelling taxa (Sialis (H and L ponds) and Chironomidae (H ponds)). 4. The number of invertebrate taxa in macrophytes declined with increasing crayfish abundance. The percentage of macrophyte-associated invertebrate taxa differed between ponds, but also between sites. The relative biomass of Gastropoda declined in H ponds where crayfish were abundant. In H ponds Trichoptera or Gammarus sp. and Heteroptera dominated where crayfish were abundant, whereas Odonata dominated in L ponds with abundant crayfish. 5. The organic content of the sediment decreased in ponds with high crayfish densities, while the amount of periphyton on stones was not related to crayfish density. 6. We conclude that the signal crayfish may play an important role as a keystone consumer in pond ecosystems, but lower trophic levels did not respond to changes in the abundance of the crayfish according to the trophic cascade model. Omnivorous crayfish may decouple the cascading effect.},

We measured key characteristics of all tree species in which agile gibbons slept, including exposure of the tree crown, root system, height, species and presence of food. Gibbons most frequently slept in Dipterocarpaceae and Fabaceae trees and preferentially chose trees taller than average, slept above the mean canopy height and showed a preference for liana-free trees. These choices could reflect avoidance of competition with other frugivores, but we argue these choices reflect gibbons prioritizing avoidance of predation. The results highlight that gibbons are actively selecting and rejecting sleeping trees based on several characteristics. The importance of the presence of large trees for food is noted and provides insight into gibbon antipredatory behaviour.},

We used a theoretical approach to show that the network architecture favoring stability fundamentally differs between trophic and mutualistic networks. A highly connected and nested architecture promotes community stability in mutualistic networks, whereas the stability of trophic networks is enhanced in compartmented and weakly connected architectures. These theoretical predictions are supported by a meta-analysis on the architecture of a large series of real pollination (mutualistic) and herbivory (trophic) networks. We conclude that strong variations in the stability of architectural patterns constrain ecological networks toward different architectures, depending on the type of interaction.},

abstract = {Introduction Food-web models, which depict the trophic relationships between organisms within a community, form a powerful and versatile approach to study the relationships between community structure and ecosystem functioning. Although food-web models have recently been applied to a wide range of ecological studies (Memmott, 2009; Sanders et al., 2014), such approaches can be greatly improved by introducing high-resolution trophic information from empirical studies and experiments that realistically describe topological structure and energy flows (de Ruiter et al., 2005). Over the last decades major technological advances have been made in empirically characterizing trophic networks by describing, in detail, the connectedness and flows in food webs. Existing empirical techniques, such as stable isotope probing (SIP) (Layman et al., 2012), have been refined and new approaches have been created by combining methods, e.g., combining Raman spectroscopy or fatty acid analysis with SIP (Ruess et al., 2005a; Li et al., 2013). These empirical methods can provide insight into different aspects of food webs and together form an extensive toolbox to investigate trophic interactions. It is crucial to recognize the potential and limitations of a range of empirical approaches in order to choose the right method in the design of empirically based food-web studies. Empirically based food webs are generally classified according to the type of input information that is required. In the following lines we will provide an overview of four types of food-web model: connectedness webs, semi-quantitative webs, energy-flow webs, and functional webs. Paine (1980) introduced three of those webs, which are widely accepted and applied in food-web studies across ecosystems. We propose to add a fourth type of empirically based food web, the semi-quantitative web. All of these food webs have the same basic structure, but the conceptual webs differ in the type of trophic information they describe and represent (Figure 16.1). Connectedness webs (Figure 16.1a) define the basic structure of a food web by describing the food-web connections per se.},

abstract = {Links in food webs can be classified as functional, which affect robustness, and redundant, which do not affect robustness. We explore whether this topologically based distinction may still be informative when interaction strength is considered. In 81 weighted food webs we identified functional and redundant links by exploiting the method of generalized dominators, and tested whether the two groups could be patterned according to link strength. Overall, redundant connections are weaker than functional links. However this pattern does not hold for every food web. Also, the difference in strength between functional and redundant links seems to depend on food web topology. In fact the systems in which redundant connections are significantly weaker than functional ones show greater connectance than systems in which the difference in strength between the two groups is not significant. We observed that redundant connections are fundamental in the formation of omnivory modules that have been described as being crucial for the stability/persistence of food webs. Although stability can be promoted by the specific arrangement of links magnitude within these modules, it does not necessarily imply that redundant links have to be weaker than functional connections at the whole web scale.},

The selection of most priority area networks focuses, however, primarily on species richness and occurrence. The effectiveness of this approach in capturing higher order manifestations of biodiversity, that is ecosystem and environmental diversity patterns, remains poorly understood. Using a case study of birds and environmental data from South Africa and Lesotho, we test how complementary networks that maximise species diversity perform with regard to their representation of ecosystem and environmental diversity, and vice versa. We compare these results to the performance of the existing reserve network. We conclude that focusing on any single biodiversity component alone is insufficient to protect other components.

We compiled the most comprehensive spatially explicit data set available for parasites, projected range shifts in a changing climate, and estimated extinction rates for eight major parasite clades. On the basis of 53, 133 occurrences capturing the geographic ranges of 457 parasite species, conservative model projections suggest that 5 to 10{\%} of these species are committed to extinction by 2070 from climate-driven habitat loss alone. We find no evidence that parasites with zoonotic potential have a significantly higher potential to gain range in a changing climate, but we do find that ectoparasites (especially ticks) fare disproportionately worse than endoparasites. Accounting for host-driven coextinctions, models predict that up to 30{\%} of parasitic worms are committed to extinction, driven by a combination of direct and indirect pressures. Despite high local extinction rates, parasite richness could still increase by an order of magnitude in some places, because species successfully tracking climate change invade temperate ecosystems and replace native species with unpredictable ecological consequences.},

abstract = {Natural ecosystems typically consist of many small and few large organisms. The scaling of this negative relationship between body mass and abundance has important implications for resource partitioning and energy usage. Global warming over the next century is predicted to favour smaller organisms, producing steeper mass-abundance scaling and a less efficient transfer of biomass through the food web. Here, we show that the opposite effect occurs in a natural warming experiment involving 13 whole-stream ecosystems within the same catchment, which span a temperature gradient of 5-25 °C. We introduce a mechanistic model that shows how the temperature dependence of basal resource carrying capacity can account for these previously unexpected results. If nutrient supply increases with temperature to offset the rising metabolic demand of primary producers, there will be sufficient resources to sustain larger consumers at higher trophic levels. These new data and the model that explains them highlight important exceptions to some commonly assumed 'rules' about responses to warming in natural ecosystems.},

@article{Rawcliffe2010,
abstract = {Shallow lakes are often cited as classic examples of systems that exhibit trophic cascades but, whilst they provide good model systems with which to test general ecological theory and to assess long-term community change, their food web linkages have rarely been resolved, so changes associated with the structure and dynamics of the ecological network as a whole are still poorly understood. We sought to redress this, and to demonstrate the potential benefits of integrating palaeolimnological and contemporary data, by constructing highly resolved food webs and stable isotope derived measures of trophic interactions and niche space, for the extant communities of two shallow U.K. lakes from different positions along a gradient of eutrophication. The contemporary surface sediment cladoceran and submerged macrophyte assemblages in the less enriched site, Selbrigg Pond, matched the palaeolimnological assemblages of the more enriched site, Felbrigg Hall Lake, in its more pristine state during the 1920s. Thus, Selbrigg was a temporal analogue for Felbrigg, from which the consequences of long-term eutrophication on food web structure could be inferred. These data represent the first steps towards reconstructing not only past assemblages (i.e. nodes within a food web), but also past interactions (i.e. links within a food web): a significant departure from much of the previous research in palaeolimnology. The more eutrophic food web had far fewer nodes and links, and thus a less reticulate network, than was the case for the more pristine system. In isotopic terms, there was vertical compression in $\delta$15N range (NR) and subsequent increased overlap in isotopic niche space, indicating increased trophic redundancy within Felbrigg. This structural change, which was associated with a greater channelling of energy through a smaller number of nodes as alternative feeding pathways disappear, could lead to reduced dynamic stability, pushing the network towards further simplification. These changes reflected a general shift from a benthic-dominated towards a more pelagic system, as the plant-associated subweb eroded. Although these data are among the first of their kind, the palaeo-analogue approach used here demonstrates the huge potential for applying food web theory to understand how and why these ecological networks change during eutrophication. Furthermore, because of the rich biological record preserved in their sediments, shallow lakes represent potentially important models for examining long-term intergenerational dynamics, thereby providing a means by which models and data can be integrated on meaningful timescales - a goal that has long proved elusive in food web ecology. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {A planktonic food-web model including sixty-three functional nodes (representing auto-mixo-and heterotrophs) was developed to integrate most trophic diversity present in the plankton. The model was implemented in two variants-which we named 'green' and 'blue'-characterized by opposite amounts of phytoplankton biomass and representing, respectively, bloom and non-bloom states of the system. Taxonomically disaggregated food-webs described herein allowed to shed light on how components of the plankton community changed their trophic behavior in the two different conditions, and modified the overall functioning of the plankton food web. The green and blue food-webs showed distinct organizations in terms of trophic roles of the nodes and carbon fluxes between them. Such reorganization stemmed from switches in selective grazing by both metazoan and protozoan consumers. Switches in food-web structure resulted in relatively small differences in the efficiency of material transfer towards higher trophic levels. For instance, from green to blue states, a seven-fold decrease in phytoplankton biomass translated into only a two-fold decrease in potential planktivorous fish biomass. By linking diversity, structure and function in the plankton food-web, we discuss the role of internal mechanisms, relying on species-specific functionalities, in driving the 'adaptive' responses of plankton communities to perturbations.},

abstract = {Factor analyses of 75 facet scales from 2 major Big Five inventories, in the Eugene-Springfield community sample (N = 481), produced a 2-factor solution for the 15 facets in each domain. These findings indicate the existence of 2 distinct (but correlated) aspects within each of the Big Five, representing an intermediate level of personality structure between facets and domains. The authors characterized these factors in detail at the item level by correlating factor scores with the International Personality Item Pool (L. R. Goldberg, 1999). These correlations allowed the construction of a 100-item measure of the 10 factors (the Big Five Aspect Scales [BFAS]), which was validated in a 2nd sample (N = 480). Finally, the authors examined the correlations of the 10 factors with scores derived from 10 genetic factors that a previous study identified underlying the shared variance among the Revised NEO Personality Inventory facets (K. L. Jang et al., 2002). The correspondence was strong enough to suggest that the 10 aspects of the Big Five may have distinct biological substrates. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Psychological Association.},

abstract = {This chapter assesses long-term projections of climate change for the end of the 21st century and beyond, where the forced signal depends on the scenario and is typically larger than the internal variability of the climate system. Changes are expressed with respect to a baseline period of 1986-2005, unless otherwise stated. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) presents an unprecedented level of information on which to base projections including new Earth System Models with a more complete representation of forcings, new Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) scenarios and more output available for analysis. The four RCP scenarios used in CMIP5 lead to a total radiative forcing (RF) at 2100 that spans a wider range than that estimated for the three Special Report on Emission Scenarios (SRES) scenarios (B1, A1B, A2) used in the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4), RCP2.6 being almost 2 W m-2 lower than SRES B1 by 2100. The magnitude of future aerosol forcing decreases more rapidly in RCP scenarios, reaching lower values than in SRES scenarios through the 21st century. Carbon dioxide (CO2) represents about 80 to 90{\%} of the total anthropogenic forcing in all RCP scenarios through the 21st century. The ensemble mean total effective RFs at 2100 for CMIP5 concentration-driven projections are 2.2, 3.8, 4.8 and 7.6 W m-2 for RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 and RCP8.5 respectively, relative to about 1850, and are close to corresponding Integrated Assessment Model (IAM)-based estimates (2.4, 4.0, 5.2 and 8.0 W m-2).},

abstract = {Altitudinal gradients provide a useful space-for-time substitution to examine the capacity for plant competition and facilitation to mediate responses to climate change. Decomposing net interactions into their facilitative and competitive components, and quantifying the performance of plants with and without neighbours along altitudinal gradients, may prove particularly informative in understanding the mechanisms behind plant responses to environmental change. To decouple the inherent responses of species to climate from the responses of plant-plant interactions to climate, we conducted a meta-analysis. Using data from 16 alpine experiments, we tested if changes in net interactions along altitudinal gradients were due to a change in the performance of target species without neighbours (i.e. environmental severity effects only) or with neighbours (neighbour trait mediated effects). There was a global shift from competition to facilitation with increasing altitude driven by both environmental severity and neighbour trait effects. However, this global pattern was strongly influenced by the high number of studies in mesic climates and driven by competition at low altitude in temperate climates (neighbour trait effect), and facilitation at high altitude in arctic and temperate climates (environmental severity effect). In Mediterranean systems, there was no significant effect of competition, and facilitation increased with decreasing altitude. Changes in facilitation with altitude could not unambiguously be attributed to either neighbour trait effects or environmental severity effects, probably because of the opposing stress gradients of cold and aridity in dry environments. Partitioning net interactions along altitudinal gradients led to the prediction that climate change should decrease the importance of facilitation in mesic alpine communities, which might in turn exacerbate the negative effects of climate change in these regions. In xeric climates, the importance of facilitation by drought-tolerant species should increase at low altitudes which should mitigate the negative effect of climate change. However, the importance of facilitation by cold-tolerant species at high altitudes may decrease and exacerbate the effects of climate change. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

abstract = {In complex, modern food webs, the analysis of pairwise interactions gives weak predictions of the behaviour of either single species or the whole community. Indirect effects call for explicit study and quantification. However, just as focusing only on pairwise interactions is incorrect, overemphasising the role of long, indirect pathways also seems to be unrealistic. Thus, a reasonable range of indirect trophic effects spreading through the food web is to be defined and quantified. I suggest a graph theoretical measure for quantifying this range, considering only network position (topology). I call this the trophic field of a species (or trophic group), recalling the idea that field theory could be a fruitful research programme in biology. Further, I propose a measure for the quantification of the indirect component of the trophic field. Finally, the use of introduced concepts and indices is illustrated by analysing the trophic flow network of the Schlei Fjord ecosystem (N. Germany).},

abstract = {A keystone species complex (KSC) is a small set of interacting species that play an outstandingly important role in community organization. Two KSC indices are suggested and have been calculated in the coastal benthic/pelagic ecosystem of Fildes Bay, King George Island (Antarctica). These indices of keystoneness emerge after considering: (1) functional indices based on steady-state and dynamic quantitative trophic models (using bottom-up, mixed and top-down control flow mechanisms); (2) structural indices including bottom-up and top-down control mechanisms, (3) semi-quantitative (qualitative) keystone indices using loop analysis (under mixed control); and (4) topological key player indices based on the centrality of node sets in the network. The models constructed and analyzed describe the interactions of the most abundant species and functional groups inhabiting the coastal ecological systems of Fildes Bay. Although our results only represent the transient dynamics of these ecological systems, the KSC indices identified the following trophically connected common core of components: the functional groups of Seastars (top-predators), the herbivorous sea urchin species Sterechinus neumayeri and the Phytoplankton (primary producers). The KSC indices for Fildes Bay could facilitate the design and assessment of conservation monitoring, especially when the Antarctic ecosystems are being severely stressed by the direct effects of global warming and UV radiation. A more holistic view of conservation remains difficult because the traditional view is based principally on single species. This imposes an even greater challenge, for global changes accompany the network of interacting species, co-varying with the variables of the natural system.},

However, we seldom have the opportunity to evaluate the long-term, indirect, and often slow-moving cascading effects of invasions at the community and ecosystem scale. Here we synthesize the collective knowledge from 10 years of study on the influence of the deep historical introduction of coconut palms (Cocos nucifera L.) across a series of islets at Palmyra Atoll. Through a suite of pathways, we find this palm drives near-complete ecosystem state change when it becomes dominant. Abiotic conditions are transformed, with major soil nutrients 2.7-11.5 times lower and water stress 15{\%} elevated in palm-dominated forests compared with native forest. Faunal communities are likewise dramatically altered, not only in composition but also in behavior, body size, and body condition. Biotic interactions, including herbivory rates, palatability, and seed predation, are likewise changed. Cumulatively, these changes transform food webs, leading to dramatically shortened and simplified food chains in invaded ecosystems. Many of these changes appear to create slow-acting feedback loops that favor the palm at the expense of native species. Given the widespread nature of this historical introduction, many island and coastal regions of tropical oceans may be similarly transformed.},

We conducted two sets of studies with users which looked at the issues of both manuals and excess features with common domestic and personal products. The quantitative set was a series of questionnaires administered to 170 people over 7 years. The qualitative set consisted of two 6-month longitudinal studies based on diaries and interviews with a total of 15 participants. We found that manuals are not read by the majority of people, and most do not use all the features of the products that they own and use regularly. Men are more likely to do both than women, and younger people are less likely to use manuals than middle-aged and older ones. More educated people are also less likely to read manuals. Over-featuring and being forced to consult manuals also appears to cause negative emotional experiences. Implications of these findings are discussed.},

abstract = {Quantifying the ecological importance of individual habitats to highly mobile animals is challenging because patterns of habitat reliance for these taxa are complex and difficult to observe. We investigated the importance of lagoons to the manta ray, Manta alfredi, a wide-ranging and vulnerable species in a less-disturbed atoll ecosystem. Lagoons are highly sensitive to anthropogenic disturbance and are known to be ecologically important to a wide variety of mobile species. We used a novel combination of research tools to examine the reliance of M. alfredi on lagoon habitats. Stable isotope analysis was used to assay the recent energetic importance of lagoons to M. alfredi; high-resolution tracking data provided information about how M. alfredi utilised lagoonal habitats over long and short time periods; acoustic cameras logged patterns of animal entrances and departures from lagoons; and photo identification/laser photogrammetry provided some insight into why they may be using this habitat. M. alfredi showed strong evidence of energetic dependence on lagoon resources during the course of the study and spent long periods of residence within lagoons or frequently transited into them from elsewhere. While within lagoons, they demonstrated affinities for particular structural features within this habitat and showed evidence of temporal patterning in habitat utilization. This work sheds light on how and why M. alfredi uses lagoons and raises questions about how this use may be altered in disturbed settings. More generally, these observations contribute to our knowledge of how to assess the ecological importance of particular habitats situated within the broader home range of mobile consumers. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Summary: Ecological communities are composed of populations connected in tangled networks of ecological interactions. Therefore, the extinction of a species can reverberate through the network and cause other (possibly distantly connected) species to go extinct as well. The study of these secondary extinctions is a fertile area of research in ecological network theory. However, to facilitate practical applications, several improvements to the current analytical approaches are needed. In particular, we need to consider that (i) species have different 'a priori' probabilities of extinction, (ii) disturbances can simultaneously affect several species, and (iii) extinction risk of consumers likely grows with resource loss. All these points can be included in dynamical models, which are, however, difficult to parameterize. Here we advance the study of secondary extinctions with Bayesian networks. We show how this approach can account for different extinction responses using binary - where each resource has the same importance - and quantitative data - where resources are weighted by their importance. We simulate ecological networks using a popular dynamical model (the Allometric Trophic Network model) and use it to test our method. We find that the Bayesian network model captures the majority of the secondary extinctions produced by the dynamical model and that consumers' responses to species loss are best modelled using a nonlinear sigmoid function. We also show that an approach based exclusively on food web structure loses power when species at higher trophic levels are preferentially lost. Because the loss of apex predators is unfortunately widespread, the results highlight a serious limitation of studies on network robustness. {\textcopyright} 2013 British Ecological Society.},

Theory predicts that such secondary extinctions are driven primarily by loss of species from intermediate or basal trophic levels. In contrast, most cases of secondary extinctions from natural systems have been attributed to loss of entire top trophic levels. Here, we show that loss of single predator species in isolation can, irrespective of their identity or the presence of other predators, trigger rapid secondary extinction cascades in natural communities far exceeding those generally predicted by theory. In contrast, we did not find any secondary extinctions caused by intermediate consumer loss. A food web model of our experimental system—a marine rocky shore community—could reproduce these results only when biologically likely and plausible nontrophic interactions, based on competition for space and predator-avoidance behaviour, were included. These findings call for a reassessment of the scale and nature of extinction cascades, particularly the inclusion of nontrophic interactions, in forecasts of the future of biodiversity.},

We then identify four paradigms for metacommunities: the patch-dynamic view, the species-sorting view, the mass effects view and the neutral view, that each emphasizes different processes of potential importance in metacommunities. These have somewhat distinct intellectual histories and we discuss elements related to their potential future synthesis. We then use this framework to discuss why the concept is useful in modifying existing ecological thinking and illustrate this with a number of both theoretical and empirical examples. As ecologists strive to understand increasingly complex mechanisms and strive to work across multiple scales of spatio-temporal organization, concepts like the metacommunity can provide important insights that frequently contrast with those that would be obtained with more conventional approaches based on local communities alone.},

Surface deposit-feeders and suspension-feeders underwent pronounced shifts in importance, with higher values in the shallow stations during summer. This variability was probably due to storm-induced disturbances. Other processes such as predation and anthropic action seemed to be spread along the inner shelf.

Here we provide an overview of the history and applicability of functional diversity in ecological studies. We found that the idea of functional diversity emerged many times and in distinct fields over the years. Functional diversity was conceived as an alternative classification to measure the ecological importance of species in a community, as well as a way to understand how biodiversity affects specific ecosystem functions. Gradually, new questions regarding functional traits emerged. Some examples include understanding species competitive abilities, patterns of species co-occurrence, community assembly, and the role of different traits on ecosystem functioning. The increasing use of functional-based approaches fueled the search for new metrics aiming at accurately estimating functional diversity and, consequently, categorical-based classifications of functional traits have been gradually replaced by continuous multi-trait approaches. More recently, the role of functional diversity was recognized as a key factor to maintain important functions and services of ecosystems. We present empirical evidence supporting this statement.},

Alewife are a keystone predator that structure the zooplankton community through strong predation on large-bodied zooplankton species, which releases small zooplankton species, such as Bosmina spp., from competition and predation pressure. In southern New England there are lakes without alewife, lakes with anadromous alewife that only reside in lakes during the summer, and lakes with landlocked alewife that reside in lakes year-round. The entire zooplankton community of these lakes is structured differently based on the presence and type of alewife they contain. We examined differences in the morphology of Bosmina spp. from sediment core samples and contemporary zooplankton samples between lakes with different types of alewife. We found that there were significant differences in the morphology of Bosmina spp. between lakes with and without alewife. We also used discriminant analysis on the morphology of Bosmina spp. to classify lakes in terms of alewife presence and alewife type. We found that the morphology of Bosmina spp. can serve as a useful proxy for detecting the presence, but not the life history type of alewife from paleoecological and contemporary inferences. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

The modification and use of tools during hunting, however, is still considered to be a uniquely human trait among primates. Here, we report the first account of habitual tool use during vertebrate hunting by nonhumans. At the Fongoli site in Senegal, we observed ten different chimpanzees use tools to hunt prosimian prey in 22 bouts. This includes immature chimpanzees and females, members of age-sex classes not normally characterized by extensive hunting behavior. Chimpanzees made 26 different tools, and we were able to recover and analyze 12 of these. Tool construction entailed up to five steps, including trimming the tool tip to a point. Tools were used in the manner of a spear, rather than a probe or rousing tool. This new information on chimpanzee tool use has important implications for the evolution of tool use and construction for hunting in the earliest hominids, especially given our observations that females and immature chimpanzees exhibited this behavior more frequently than adult males. {\textcopyright}2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Mesocosms are used extensively by ecologists to gain a mechanistic understanding of ecosystems based on the often untested assumption that these systems can replicate the key attributes of natural assemblages. Previous investigations of stream mesocosm utility have explored community composition, but here for the first time, we extend the approach to consider the replicability and realism of food webs in four outdoor channels (4m2). The four food webs were similarly complex, consisting of diverse assemblages (61-71 taxa) with dense feeding interactions (directed connectance 0{\textperiodcentered}09-0{\textperiodcentered}11). Mesocosm food web structural attributes were within the range reported for 82 well-characterized food webs from natural streams and rivers. When compared with 112 additional food webs from standing freshwater, marine, estuarine and terrestrial environments, stream food webs (including mesocosms) had similar characteristic path lengths, but typically lower mean food chain length and exponents for the species-link relationship. Body size (M) abundance (N) allometric scaling coefficients for trivariate taxonomic mesocosm food webs (-0{\textperiodcentered}53 to -0{\textperiodcentered}49) and individual size distributions (-0{\textperiodcentered}60 to -0{\textperiodcentered}58) were consistent and similar to those from natural systems, suggesting that patterns of energy flux between mesocosm consumers and resources were realistic approximations. These results suggest that stream mesocosms of this scale can support replicate food webs with a degree of biocomplexity that is comparable to 'natural' streams. The findings highlight the potential value of mesocosms as model systems for performing experimental manipulations to test ecological theories, at spatiotemporal scales of relevance to natural ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {The group model is a useful tool to understand broad-scale patterns of interaction in a network, but it has previously been limited in use to food webs, which contain only predator-prey interactions. Natural populations interact with each other in a variety of ways and, although most published ecological networks only include information about a single interaction type (e.g., feeding, pollination), ecologists are beginning to consider networks which combine multiple interaction types. Here we extend the group model to signed directed networks such as ecological interaction webs. As a specific application of this method, we examine the effects of including or excluding specific interaction types on our understanding of species roles in ecological networks. We consider all three currently available interaction webs, two of which are extended plant-mutualist networks with herbivores and parasitoids added, and one of which is an extended intertidal food web with interactions of all possible sign structures (+/+, -/0, etc.). Species in the extended food web grouped similarly with all interactions, only trophic links, and only nontrophic links. However, removing mutualism or herbivory had a much larger effect in the extended plant-pollinator webs. Species removal even affected groups that were not directly connected to those that were removed, as we found by excluding a small number of parasitoids. These results suggest that including additional species in the network provides far more information than additional interactions for this aspect of network structure. Our methods provide a useful framework for simplifying networks to their essential structure, allowing us to identify generalities in network structure and better understand the roles species play in their communities.},

abstract = {Aquatic ecosystems face several major challenges from the introduction and invasion of species, to overfishing. In order to better manage these situations, we need predictive models, where diverse scenarios can be simulated and tested. One key challenge to address is how to quantify the relationships between single-species disturbances and their multispecies effects. Mapping the spread of direct and indirect effects in food webs helps to link species to communities. Since food webs are complex networks of interactions, it is typically not easy to make predictions, so modelling and simulation may help to reveal general patterns. In food web simulations, one can quantify the effects of local perturbations on other species, i.e., community response. This may provide information about the relative importance of individual species and it is also useful to assess the vulnerability of the whole community to local changes. However, community response can be measured in several ways and various response functions give different results. In order to better understand their similarities and differences, we present a comparative study on a reasonable set of community response functions in food web simulations. These results contribute to build more predictive, multi-species models for systems-based conservation and management.},

This analysis of 60 invertebrate-dominated community food webs confirms the existence of all but one of these properties in such webs and addresses a common concern held by critics of food web theory that observed food web properties may be sensitive to trophic aggregation. The food web statistics (chain length; predator/prey ratio; fraction of top, intermediate, and bottom species; and rigid circuits) are scaling in the sense that they remain roughly invariant over a wide range of data resolution.

abstract = {Species that have outstanding importance in the functioning of a community are called keystone species. Network indices are increasingly used to identify them, e.g. for conservation biological purposes. The problem is that the calculation of these indices is based on the particular network model of the studied food web, which can include network construction errors. For example, additional, unnecessary trophic links can be built in, or, to the contrary, functional links can be left out. What is the effect of such errors on the result of network analysis, e.g. the centrality values of species? Can you rely on the importance rank of species that you calculated? We developed a robustness measure (R) for network indices to answer these questions. R is proportional to the likeliness that the importance rank of nodes in the given network according to a given index would not change due to possible errors in network construction. For calculating R, first the maximum expected error (P) has to be computed which represents the potential range of error in estimating the keystone index in question. Basically, R is calculated by comparing P to the keystone indices of species to assess the reliability of the importance rank of species based on the network model. We calculated the robustness of 13 different structural indices in 26 food webs of different size to test the P and R values. We found that fragmentation indices and the number of dominated nodes can be characterized by quite low R values, while betweenness, topological importance, keystoneness and mixed trophic impact have high R values, which means that they are relatively more reliable for assessing the importance rank of species in an uncertain network model. However, as R was found to be very variable, depending on the topology of a given network, a detailed description is provided for performing the actual calculations case-by-case.

abstract = {1. Attempts to quantify the impact of non-native plants on the vegetation of invaded habitats have often been criticized because of the frequent use of observational assessments (invaded/uninvaded comparisons) focused on local-rather than community-level effects. This study highlights how removal experiments combined with partitioning of diversity components across spatial scales can provide key insights into invasive species' impacts. 2. Impatiens glandulifera (Balsaminaceae) is a widespread invasive riparian weed, yet few quantitative assessments of its impact on natural vegetation exist. Thus replicated experiments were used to compare the impact of Impatiens removal on {\$}\alpha{\$} , {\$}\beta{\$} , {\$}\gamma{\$} components of species richness, diversity and evenness in open riparian habitats in northeast England. 3. Plant community response to Impatiens removal was rapid, with a significant increase in seedling recruitment resulting in an average increase of four species m − 2. The impact of Impatiens invasion was most marked for light-demanding species. Eight non-native species (in addition to Impatiens) occurred in the community and these responded proportionally more to Impatiens removal than native species. As a result the proportion of non-native species in removal plots was higher than in invaded plots. 4. The increase in {\$}\alpha{\$} richness and diversity following Impatiens removal was matched by a similar increase in the {\$}\gamma{\$} components. Thus the effect of Impatiens was significant at both the local plot scale and at the scale of the riparian community, although the former effect was more marked. Species accumulation curves suggested that extensive Impatiens stands may reduce species richness by as much as 25{\%}. 5. Synthesis and applications. Removal experiments appear particularly well suited to assess the impacts of herbaceous non-native plants on ruderal communities. By partitioning diversity components, impacts were consistently assessed at local and community scales and, when combined with analysis of species accumulation curves, provided a comprehensive assessment of impact on the plant community. The approach adopted in this study highlights that although Impatiens reduces native species diversity in open and frequently disturbed riparian vegetation, many of the species negatively influenced by Impatiens are widespread ruderal species. Furthermore, management may lead to a compensatory increase in the abundance of other non-native species and thus fail to achieve desired conservation goals.},

abstract = {Climate change would have profound influences on community structure and composition, and subsequently has impacts on ecosystem functioning and feedback to climate change. A field experiment with increased temperature and precipitation was conducted to examine effects of experimental warming, increased precipitation and their interactions on community structure and composition in a temperate steppe in northern China since April 2005. Increased precipitation significantly stimulated species richness and coverage of plant community. In contrast, experimental warming markedly reduced species richness of grasses and community coverage. Species richness was positively dependent upon soil moisture (SM) across all treatments and years. Redundancy analysis (RDA) illustrated that SM dominated the response of community composition to climate change at the individual level, suggesting indirect effects of climate change on plant community composition via altering water availability. In addition, species interaction also mediated the responses of functional group coverage to increased precipitation and temperature. Our observations revealed that both abiotic (soil water availability) and biotic (interspecific interactions) factors play important roles in regulating plant community structure and composition in response to climate change in the semiarid steppe. Therefore these factors should be incorporated in model predicting terrestrial vegetation dynamics under climate change. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Analysis of ecological networks is a valuable approach to understanding the vulnerability of systems to disturbance. The tolerance of ecological networks to coextinctions, resulting from sequences of primary extinctions (here termed “knockout extinction models”, in contrast with other dynamic approaches), is a widely used tool for modeling network “robustness”. Currently, there is an emphasis to increase biological realism in these models, but less attention has been given to the effect of model choices and network structure on robustness measures. Here, we present a suite of knockout extinction models for bipartite ecological networks (specifically plant–pollinator networks) that can all be analyzed on the same terms, enabling us to test the effects of extinction rules, interaction weights, and network structure on robustness. We include two simple ecologically plausible models of propagating extinctions, one new and one adapted from existing models. All models can be used with weighted or binary interaction data. We found that the choice of extinction rules impacts robustness; our two propagating models produce opposing effects in all tests on observed plant–pollinator networks. Adding weights to the interactions tends to amplify the opposing effects and increase the variation in robustness. Variation in robustness is a key feature of these extinction models and is driven by the structural heterogeneity of nodes (specifically, the skewness of the plant degree distribution) in the network. Our analysis therefore reveals the mechanisms and fundamental network properties that drive observed trends in robustness.},

abstract = {Studies in lakes show that fish and crayfish predators play an important role in determining the abundance of freshwater snails. In contrast, there are few studies of snails and their predators in shallow ponds and marshes. Ponds often lack fish and crayfish but have abundant insect populations. Here we present the results of field surveys, laboratory foraging trials, and an outdoor mesocosm experiment, testing the hypothesis that insects are important predators of pulmonate snails. In laboratory foraging trials, conducted with ten species of insects, most insect taxa consumed snails, and larval dragonflies were especially effective predators. The field surveys showed that dragonflies constitute the majority of the insect biomass in fishless ponds. More focused foraging trials evaluated the ability of the dragonflies Anax junius and Pantala hymenaea to prey upon different sizes and species of pulmonate snails (Helisoma trivolvis, Physa acuta, and Stagnicola elodes). Anax junius consumed all three species up to the maximum size tested. Pantala hymenaea consumed snails with a shell height of 3 mm and smaller, but did not kill larger snails. P. acuta were more vulnerable to predators than were H. trivolvis or S. elodes. In the mesocosm experiment, conducted with predator treatments of A. junius, P. hymenaea, and the hemipteran Belostoma flumineum, insect predators had a pronounced negative effect on snail biomass and density. A. junius and B. flumineum reduced biomass and density to a similar degree, and both reduced biomass more than did P. hymenaea. Predators did not have a strong effect on species composition. A model suggested that A. junius and P. hymenaea have the largest effects on snail biomass in the field. Given that both pulmonate snails and dragonfly nymphs are widespread and abundant in marshes and ponds, snail assemblages in these water bodies are likely regulated in large part by odonate predation. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {This study explored whether the tendency of chimpanzees and children to use emulation or imitation to solve a tool-using task was a response to the availability of causal information. Young wild-born chimpanzees from an African sanctuary and 3- to 4-year-old children observed a human demonstrator use a tool to retrieve a reward from a puzzle-box. The demonstration involved both causally relevant and irrelevant actions, and the box was presented in each of two conditions: opaque and clear. In the opaque condition, causal information about the effect of the tool inside the box was not available, and hence it was impossible to differentiate between the relevant and irrelevant parts of the demonstration. However, in the clear condition causal information was available, and subjects could potentially determine which actions were necessary. When chimpanzees were presented with the opaque box, they reproduced both the relevant and irrelevant actions, thus imitating the overall structure of the task. When the box was presented in the clear condition they instead ignored the irrelevant actions in favour of a more efficient, emulative technique. These results suggest that emulation is the favoured strategy of chimpanzees when sufficient causal information is available. However, if such information is not available, chimpanzees are prone to employ a more comprehensive copy of an observed action. In contrast to the chimpanzees, children employed imitation to solve the task in both conditions, at the expense of efficiency. We suggest that the difference in performance of chimpanzees and children may be due to a greater susceptibility of children to cultural conventions, perhaps combined with a differential focus on the results, actions and goals of the demonstrator. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2005.},

abstract = {Most knowledge of direct and indirect effects of zooplanktivorous fish has come from studies in which a treatment with a zooplanktivore is compared to a fishless control. However, effects of a zooplanktivore may be different in the presence of other fish species because the other fish have direct and indirect effects that may alter the effects of the zooplanktivore in question. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a tank mesocosm experiment of 2x2 factorial design in which the presence and absence of bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus) were cross-classified with the presence and absence of a fish assemblage composed of western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio). The presence of bluegill decreased Daphnia, Ceriodaphnia, cyclopoid copepodids, calanoid copepodids, copepod nauplii, amphipods, gastropods, and notonectids. Daphnia, Ceriodaphnia, cyclopoid copepodids, copepod nauplii, gastropods, notonectids, Najas, and Chara were decreased and herbivorous rotifers, turbidity, chlorophyll a, total nitrogen and total phosphorus were increased in the presence of the fish assemblage. Significant bluegillxfish assemblage interaction effects were detected for Daphnia, Ceriodaphnia, cyclopoid copepodids, copepod nauplii, gastropods, and notonectids. Analysis of simple effects for these response variables revealed that all significant bluegill effects in the absence of the fish assemblage were not significant in the presence of the fish assemblage. Our results indicate that the effects of bluegill may be context dependent, or dependent upon the presence of other trophically similar fish species.},

We investigated this issue by examining the annual movements of the migratory wildebeest, Connochaetes taurinus, in the 25 000 km2 Serengeti-Mara Ecosystem of Tanzania and Kenya. We used Global Positioning System telemetry to track eight wildebeest during 1999-2000 in relation to protected area status in different parts of the ecosystem. The collared wildebeest spent 90{\%} of their time within well-protected core areas. However, two sections of the wildebeest migration route - the Ikoma Open Area and the Mara Group Ranches - currently receive limited protection and are threatened by poaching or agriculture. Comparison of current wildebeest migration routes to those recorded during 1971-73 indicates that the western buffer zones appear to be used more extensively than in the past. This tentative conclusion has important repercussions for management and needs further study. The current development of community-run Wildlife Management Areas as additional buffer zones around the Serengeti represents an important step in the conservation of this UNESCO World Heritage Site. This study demonstrates that detailed knowledge of movement of migratory species is required to plan effective conservation action. {\textcopyright} 2004 The Zoological Society of London.},

abstract = {We know little about how ecosystems of different complexity will respond to global warming. Microcosms permit experimental control over species composition and rates of environmental change. Here we show using microcosm experiments that extinction risk in warming environments depends on trophic position but remains unaffected by biodiversity. Warmed communities disproportionately lose top predators and herbivores, and become increasingly dominated by autotrophs and bacterivores. Changes in the relative distribution of organisms among trophically defined functional groups lead to differences in ecosystem function beyond those expected from temperature- dependent physiological rates. Diverse communities retain more species than depauperate ones, as predicted by the insurance hypothesis, which suggests that high biodiversity buffers against the effects of environmental variation because tolerant species are more likely to be found. Studies of single trophic levels clearly show that warming can affect the distribution and abundance of species, but complex responses generated in entire food webs greatly complicate inferences based on single functional groups.},

Indices that characterize ecosystem state are helpful tools for the interpretation of ecosystem responses. The central question is how to link these responses to ecosystem structure and functioning and to quantify ecosystem persistence, resistance or resilience. Quantification and characterization of trophic networks by ecological network analysis (ENA) indices is proceeding rapidly, especially in the field of coastal ecology. In this contribution, we review several theories that relate ecosystem structure and function to stability. The structure and functioning of ecosystems change during the maturation of ecosystems. In the first section, the maturation of ecosystems is described using thermodynamics. In the second and third parts of this paper, we define some concepts for analysing structure and functioning of food webs and discuss their relation to stability. In the last section, we describe three ENA indices and their link to stability. We demonstrate that ENA provides powerful tools for describing local stability, combining quantitative and qualitative concepts. However, it remains incomplete for describing real conservation cases that combine local and global stability.},

However, it is currently unknown how managementdriven changes to community structure may interact with climate warming and other anthropogenic perturbations to alter CO2 fluxes. Here we showed that under ambient water temperatures, predators (three-spined stickleback) and nutrient enrichment synergistically increased primary producer biomass, resulting in increased CO2 uptake by mesocosms in early dawn. However, a 38C increase in water temperatures counteracted positive effects of predators and nutrients, leading to reduced primary producer biomass and a switch from CO2 influx to efflux. This confounding effect of temperature demonstrates that climate scenarios must be accounted for when undertaking ecosystem management actions to increase biosequestration.},

We used this method to make forecasts of PCB concentrations in these fishes, along with Bayesian credible-interval estimates associated with these forecasts. Point estimates of PCB concentrations in all five species show a decline through a 10-yr forecast horizon. However, upper bounds on the 90{\%} credible-interval uncertainty estimates for chinook salmon and lake trout indicate that steady or slightly increasing annual average PCB concentrations are within the 90{\%} credible interval for the 10-yr forecast horizon.

Nevertheless, there is a taxonomic bias that excludes species with small body sizes, narrow distribution ranges and low dispersal abilities, which constitute the vast majority of the planet's biota, particularly local endemics. By evaluating each IUCN criterion separately, we (i) identify the shortcomings for invertebrate applications, (ii) explain how risk categories may be wrongly applied due to inapplicable and/or misleading thresholds, (iii) suggest alternative ways of applying the existing criteria in a more realistic way and (iv) suggest possible new criteria that were not considered in the current evaluation framework but that could allow a more comprehensive and effective assessment of invertebrates. By adapting the criteria to rely more explicitly on the Area of Occupancy and the Extent of Occurrence, their respective trends and by using ecological modelling methods, the criteria's applicability would be increased. The change in some thresholds or, eventually, the creation of sub-categories would further increase their adequacy. Additionally, co-extinction could be introduced as an explicit part of the classification process. As a case study, we evaluated 48 species of Azorean arthropods and Iberian spiders according to the current criteria. More than one-quarter (27{\%}) of all evaluated species were classified as Critically Endangered, 19{\%} as Endangered, 6{\%} as Vulnerable and 8{\%} as Least Concern.

@article{Kondoh2017,
abstract = {Introduction How do so many species coexist in nature? This long-lasting question in ecology (Hutchinson, 1959) was given a new direction by the theoretical prediction, derived using a mathematical model of random communities, that a more complex community network, characterized by higher species richness or more interspecific interactions, is less likely to be stable (May, 1972). The major issue that arose was why a complex community, which should be unstable according to ecological theory, can persist in real nature. An approach that has commonly been taken to tackle the issue was to change the assumption of random community (Lawlor, 1978). This approach seems to have been successful to some extent. Indeed, recent studies that looked into the real community network have identified structural non-randomness of community networks that can help the persistence of species in a community (Neutel et al., 2002; Emmerson and Raffaelli, 2004; Kondoh, 2008; Th{\'{e}}bault and Fontaine, 2010; Stouffer and Bascompte, 2011). A number of studies were carried out to describe the detailed structure of real community networks, such as food web (de Ruiter et al., 2005) and mutualistic web (Bascompte and Jordano, 2013), and to find their structural patterns that may contribute to community stability. It is no doubt that analysis of those specific networks greatly contributed to our understanding of how ecological communities are organized and how their structure is related to community dynamics. However, at the same time, little is understood regarding the structural and dynamics properties of community networks with multiple interaction types. Actually, it is only recently that different interaction types have been put together in a single picture describing how diverse species and variety of interactions are built up into a complex network of ecological community (Ohgushi, 2005; M{\'{e}}lian et al., 2009; Th{\'{e}}bault and Fontaine, 2010; K{\'{e}}fi et al., 2012; Pocock et al., 2012; Toju et al., 2014). While a number of studies have been carried out to understand how species diversity contributes to population, community dynamics, and ecosystem processes (e.g., May, 1972; Hooper et al., 2005), it is only recently that the ecological consequence of interaction diversity has been theoretically explored (Allesina and Tang, 2012; Mougi and Kondoh, 2012, 2014a, b, c; Georgelin and Loeuille, 2014; Sanders et al., 2014; R{\'{u}}a and Umbanhowar, 2015).},

abstract = {The proliferation of artificial container habitats in urban areas has benefitted urban adaptable mosquito species globally. In areas where mosquitoes transmit viruses and parasites, it can promote vector population productivity and fuel mosquitoborne disease outbreaks. In Britain, storage of water in garden water butts is increasing, potentially expanding mosquito larval habitats and influencing population dynamics and mosquito-human contact. Here we show that the community composition, abundance and phenology of mosquitoes breeding in experimental water butt containers were influenced by urbanisation. Mosquitoes in urban containers were less species-rich but present in significantly higher densities (100.4±21.3) per container than those in rural containers (77.7±15.1). Urban containers were dominated by Culex pipiens (a potential vector of West Nile Virus [WNV]) and appear to be increasingly exploited by Anopheles plumbeus (a human-biting potential WNV and malaria vector). Culex phenology was influenced by urban land use type, with peaks in larval abundances occurring earlier in urban than rural containers. Among other factors, this was associated with an urban heat island effect which raised urban air and water temperatures by 0.9°C and 1.2°C respectively. Further increases in domestic water storage, particularly in urban areas, in combination with climate changes will likely alter mosquito population dynamics in the UK. {\textcopyright} 2014 Townroe, Callaghan.},

abstract = {1. We studied the effect of substratum movement on the communities of adjacent mountain and spring tributaries of the Ivishak River in arctic Alaska (69°1′N, 147°43′W). We expected the mountain stream to have significant bed movement during summer because of storm flows and the spring stream to have negligible bed movement because of constant discharge. 2. We predicted that the mountain stream would be inhabited only by taxa able to cope with frequent bed movement. Therefore, we anticipated that the mountain stream would have lower macroinvertebrate species richness and biomass and a food web with fewer trophic levels and lower connectance than the spring stream. 3. Substrata marked in situ indicated that 57-66{\%} of the bed moved during summer in the mountain stream and 4-20{\%} moved in the spring stream. 4. Macroinvertebrate taxon richness was greater in the spring (25 taxa) than in the mountain stream (20 taxa). Mean macroinvertebrate biomass was also greater in the spring (4617 mg dry mass m-2) than in the mountain stream (635 mg dry mass m-2). Predators contributed 25{\%} to this biomass in the spring stream, but only 7{\%} in the mountain stream. 5. Bryophyte biomass was {\textgreater}1000 times greater in the spring stream (88.4 g ash-free dry mass m-2) than the mountain stream (0.08 g ash-free dry mass m-2). We attributed this to differences in substratum stability between streams. The difference in extent of bryophyte cover between streams probably explains the high macroinvertebrate biomass in the spring stream. 6. Mean food-web connectance was similar between streams, ranging from 0.18 in the spring stream to 0.20 in the mountain stream. Mean food chain length was 3.04 in the spring stream and 1.83 in the mountain stream. Dolly Varden char (Salvelinus malma) was the top predator in the mountain stream and the American dipper (Cinclus mexicanus) was the top predator in the spring stream. The difference in mean food chain length between streams was due largely to the presence of C. mexicanus at the spring stream. 7. Structural differences between the food webs of the spring and mountain streams were relatively minor. The difference in the proportion of macroinvertebrate biomass contributing to different trophic levels was major, however, indicating significant differences in the volume of material and energy flow between food-web nodes (i.e. food web function). {\textcopyright} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The strength of interactions between predators and their prey (interaction strength) varies enormously among species within ecological communities. Understanding the community-wide distribution of interaction strengths is vital, given that communities dominated by weak interactions may be more stable and resistant to invasion. In the oceans, previous studies have reported lognormal distributions of per capita interaction strength. We estimated the distribution of predator-prey interaction strengths within a subtidal speciose herbivore community (45 species). Laboratory experiments were used to determine maximum per capita interaction strengths for eight species of herbivores (including amphipods, isopods, gastropods, and sea urchins) that graze on giant kelp (Macrocystispyrifera) microscopic stages. We found that maximum per capita interaction strength saturated as a function of individual herbivore biomass, likely caused by predator/prey size thresholds. Incorporating this nonlinearity, we predicted maximum per capita interaction strength for the remaining herbivore species. The resulting distribution of per capita interaction strengths was bimodal, in striking contrast to previous reports from other communities. Although small herbivores often had per capita interaction strengths similar to larger herbivores, their tendency to have greater densities in the field increased their potential impact as grazers. These results indicate that previous conclusions about the distributions of interaction strength in natural communities are not general, and that intermediate-sized predators can under realistic circumstances represent the most effective consumers in natural communities.},

abstract = {Species importance is often defined by how central the role a species plays in a food web. Here we argue that species importance should also incorporate the concept of uniqueness of its network position. By developing a previous methodology, we propose a new approach for species uniqueness. Our methodology quantifies the interaction structure of species, separates strong and weak interactors in a threshold-dependent way and measures the similarity of strong interactors' identity for pairs of species. By exploring various threshold values systematically, the profile of a species' trophic overlap can be constructed. Summing up the extent of trophic overlap across the whole profile for a species, we then obtain a new measure for species uniqueness. A unique species should overlap less with other species and therefore has a low value for this new measure. We demonstrate our methodology by using the food web representation of Prince Williams Sound ecosystem. Drastic differences between our new result and that derived from the previous approach are found. We further compare the result with other network indices and found that the information generated from our new approach differs from the majority others. This in turn implies our approach offer an alternative view on species importance that may complement the existing methodologies in the literature.},

abstract = {The fish community on the Atlantic deep continental shelf and upper slope to the northwest of Scotland has been the subject of biological studies for more than a century, and subject to bottom-trawl fishing for around 25 years. In this work, we examine trends in biodiversity of the deep-water demersal fish community revealed by a decade of trawl surveys by Marine Scotland-Science. The composition and structure of the fish assemblage was described using species richness as well as the descriptors of community interrelatedness: taxonomic diversity (Delta) and taxonomic distinctness (Delta*). Results revealed no temporal trends in community composition. The most significant factor in determining richness and taxonomic diversity of the demersal fish fauna was depth, and to a lesser extent latitude. Diversity and distinctness decreased with increasing depth and showed a complex relationship with latitude, while richness peaked at depths around 1400 m. This study shows taxonomic measures of diversity and distinctness to be sensitive indicators of ecological conditions in the deep-water fish community, with respect to depth and latitude, and the fact that no temporal trends were detected suggests that the structure of the fish community at exploitable depths on the Scottish slope has remained stable over the period 1998-2008. These findings imply that care should be taken when planning spatial measures designed to safeguard deep-water fish biodiversity because the optimal area recommended for protection is strongly dependent on the choice of metric used.},

abstract = {Incorporating the evolutionary history of species into community ecology enhances understanding of community composition, ecosystem functioning and responses to environmental changes. Phylogenetic history might partly explain the impact of fragmentation and land-use change on assemblages of interacting organisms and even determine potential cascading effects across trophic levels. However, it remains unclear whether phylogenetic diversity of basal resources is reflected at higher trophic levels in the food web. In particular, phylogenetic determinants of community structure have never been incorporated into habitat edge studies, even though edges are recognized as key factors affecting communities in fragmented landscapes. Here, we test whether phylogenetic diversity at different trophic levels (plants, herbivores and parasitoids) and signals of co-evolution (i.e. phylogenetic congruence) among interacting trophic levels change across an edge gradient between native and plantation forests. To ascertain whether there is a signal of co-evolution across trophic levels, we test whether related consumer species generally feed on related resource species. We found differences across trophic levels in how their phylogenetic diversity responded to the habitat edge gradient. Plant and native parasitoid phylogenetic diversity changed markedly across habitats, while phylogenetic variability of herbivores (which were predominantly native) did not change across habitats, though phylogenetic evenness declined in plantation interiors. Related herbivore species did not appear to feed disproportionately on related plant species (i.e. there was no signal of co-evolution) even when considering only native species, potentially due to the high trophic generality of herbivores. However, related native parasitoid species tended to feed on related herbivore species, suggesting the presence of a co-evolutionary signal at higher trophic levels. Moreover, this signal was stronger in plantation forests, indicating that this habitat may impose stresses on parasitoids that constrain them to attack only host species for which they are best adapted. Overall, changes in land use across native to plantation forest edges differentially affected phylogenetic diversity across trophic levels, and may also exert a strong selective pressure for particular co-evolved herbivore-parasitoid interactions.},

The emerging movement ecology paradigm offers a framework to consolidate movement research independent of taxon, life-history stage, scale, or discipline. This review applies the framework to movement among life-history stages in marine animals with complex life cycles to consolidate marine movement research and offer insights for scientists working in aquatic and terrestrial realms. Irrespective of data collection or simulation strategy, breaking each life-history stage down into the fundamental units of movement allows each unit to be studied independently or interactively with other units. Understanding these underlying mechanisms of movement within each life-history stage can then be used to construct lifetime movement paths. These paths can allow further investigation of the relative contributions and interdependencies of steps and phases across a lifetime and how these paths influence larger research topics, such as population-level movements.},

abstract = {The fate of the insecticide Dursban{\textregistered} 4E (active ingredient chlorpyrifos) and its effect on crustaceans and insects was studied in indoor experimental freshwater ecosystems that intended to mimick drainage ditches. A single dose (simulating aerial drift) was applied to achieve nominal chlorpyrifos concentrations of 5 or 35 $\mu$g/L. Two experiments were performed, one in which all model ecosystems were dominated by the macrophyte Elodea nuttallii, and one using systems devoid of macrophytes. In macrophyte-dominated systems, Elodea vegetation adsorbed a large proportion of the dose applied and hampered the mixing of the insecticide in the water (at least up till day 8). Only a small proportion became incorporated in the sediment. In open water systems the insecticide was rapidly mixed in the water, and the sediment played a very significant role as sink for chlorpyrifos. In both Elodea-dominated and open water systems 50{\%} of the dose applied had disappeared on day 8 post-treatment. The rate of disappearance of chlorpyrifos was relatively rapid in water and macrophytes, and relatively slow in the sediment. Of the arthropods in the zooplankton Cladocera were more susceptible than Copepoda. Significant effects (p≤0.05) on Cladocera occurred relatively late in Elodea-dominated systems (in week 4 post-application) in contrast to open water systems (week 1), which is in accordance with the observed differences in the fate of chlorpyrifos. Daphnia pulex, D. longispina and Simocephalus vetulus recovered in the model ecosystems when chlorpyrifos concentrations were lower than 0.1-0.2 $\mu$g/L, which is in agreement with results of laboratory protocol tests performed with these cladocerans. Among the macroscopic Arthropoda the apparent order of susceptibility was amphipods {\textgreater} insects {\textgreater} isopods. The isopod Asellus aquaticus was more sensitive to the application of the insecticide than the closely related species Proasellus coxalis. In treated open water systems the latter even increased significantly in numbers. Cage experiments in the model ecosystems performed with several species of Arthropoda indicate that laboratory protocol tests may give a reasonable prediction of short-term direct effects of chlorpyrifos for the same species inhabiting more complex aquatic systems. {\textcopyright} 1992 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.},

abstract = {It is a current challenge to better understand the relative importance of species in ecosystems, and the network perspective is able to offer quantitative tools for this. It is plausible to assume, in general, that well-linked species, being key interactors, are also more important for the community. Recently a number of methods have been suggested for quantifying the network position of species in ecological networks (like the topological importance metric, TI). Most of them are based on node centrality indices and it may happen that the two most important species in a food web have very similar interaction structure and they can essentially replace each other if one becomes extinct. For conservation considerations it is a challenge to identify species that are richly connected and, at the same time, have a relatively unique and irreplaceable interaction pattern. We present a new method and illustrate our approach by using the Kuosheng Bay trophic network in Taiwan. The new method is based on the interaction matrix, where the strength of the interaction between nodes i and j depends only on topology. By defining a threshold separating weak and strong interactors, we define the effective range of interactions for each graph node. If the overlaps between pairs of these ranges are quantified, we gain a metric expressing how unique is the interaction pattern of a focal node (TO). The combination of centrality (TI) and uniqueness (TO) is called topological functionality (TF). We compare the nodal importance rank provided by this metric to others based on a variety of centrality measures. The main conclusion is that shrimps seem to have the most unique interaction pattern despite that their structural importance has been underestimated by all conventional centrality indices. Also, our network analysis suggests that fisheries disturb the ecosystem in a more critical network position than the impingement by the local power plant. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We compare reproductive success from 1987 through 1990 at Cedar Beach, Long Island, and in 1980 and 1987 through 1990 at Bird Island, Massachusetts, to examine yearly and seasonal differences. Productivity was highest for terns breeding in the first six days of the egg-laying period and decreased thereafter. Clutch size, hatching success, and productivity declined significantly during the season, with some variations in pattern among years and between colony sites. Pairs initiating nests after 22 June fledged almost no young. Patterns of reproductive success were more irregular at the smaller colony (Cedar Beach) than the larger colony. Reproductive success was related to age of adults; young birds (two to three years old) had lower clutch sizes, had lower reproductive success, and laid later than older birds. The effective reproductive population of the colony included primarily birds that bred in the early and peak periods; thus, monitoring reproductive success only from early or peak nests overestimates overall reproductive success. Selection against even earlier breeding in this species may be due to lower food resources early in the season and higher predation rates on early nests.},

abstract = {This paper addresses two common problems that users of various products and interfaces encounter-over-featured interfaces and product documentation. Over-featured interfaces are seen as a problem as they can confuse and over-complicate everyday interactions. Researchers also often claim that users do not read product documentation, although they are often exhorted to 'RTFM' (read the field manual). We conducted two sets of studies with users which looked at the issues of both manuals and excess features with common domestic and personal products. The quantitative set was a series of questionnaires administered to 170 people over 7 years. The qualitative set consisted of two 6-month longitudinal studies based on diaries and interviews with a total of 15 participants. We found that manuals are not read by the majority of people, and most do not use all the features of the products that they own and use regularly. Men are more likely to do both than women, and younger people are less likely to use manuals than middle-aged and older ones. More educated people are also less likely to read manuals. Over-featuring and being forced to consult manuals also appears to cause negative emotional experiences. Implications of these findings are discussed.},

Bioinspired design (BID) traditionally has focused on a unit operation and single product level. In contrast, this paper describes how principles of network organization derived from analysis of ecosystem properties can be applied to industrial system networks. Specifically, this paper examines the applicability of particular food web matrix properties as design rules for economically and biologically sustainable industrial networks, using an optimization model developed for a carpet recycling network. Carpet recycling network designs based on traditional cost and emissions based optimization are compared to designs obtained using optimizations based solely on ecological food web metrics.

abstract = {Globally accelerating trends in societal development and human environmental impacts since the mid-twentieth century 1-7 are known as the Great Acceleration and have been discussed as a key indicator of the onset of the Anthropocene epoch 6 . While reports on ecological responses (for example, changes in species range or local extinctions) to the Great Acceleration are multiplying 8, 9, it is unknown whether such biotic responses are undergoing a similar acceleration over time. This knowledge gap stems from the limited availability of time series data on biodiversity changes across large temporal and geographical extents. Here we use a dataset of repeated plant surveys from 302 mountain summits across Europe, spanning 145 years of observation, to assess the temporal trajectory of mountain biodiversity changes as a globally coherent imprint of the Anthropocene. We find a continent-wide acceleration in the rate of increase in plant species richness, with five times as much species enrichment between 2007 and 2016 as fifty years ago, between 1957 and 1966. This acceleration is strikingly synchronized with accelerated global warming and is not linked to alternative global change drivers. The accelerating increases in species richness on mountain summits across this broad spatial extent demonstrate that acceleration in climate-induced biotic change is occurring even in remote places on Earth, with potentially far-ranging consequences not only for biodiversity, but also for ecosystem functioning and services.},

Since the first papers on the subject appeared, two perspectives have developed to describe how communities shift from one stable state to another. One assumes a constant environment with shifts in variables such as population density, and the other anticipates changes to underlying parameters or environmental "drivers". We review the theory behind alternative stable states and examine to what extent these perspectives are the same, and in what ways they differ. We discuss the concepts of resilience and hysteresis, and the role of stochasticity within the two formulations. In spite of differences in the two perspectives, the same type of experimental evidence is required to demonstrate the existence of alternative stable states.},

abstract = {Ecosystems are often arranged in naturally patchy landscapes with habitat patches linked by dispersal of species in a metacommunity. The size of a metacommunity, or number of patches, is predicted to influence community dynamics and therefore the structure and function of local communities. However, such predictions have yet to be experimentally tested using full food webs in natural metacommunities. We used the natural mesocosm system of aquatic macroinvertebrates in bromeliad phytotelmata to test the effect of the number of patches in a metacommunity on species richness, abundance, and community composition. We created metacommunities of varying size using fine mesh cages to enclose a gradient from a single bromeliad up to the full forest. We found that species richness, abundance, and biomass increased from enclosed metacommunities to the full forest size and that diversity and evenness also increased in larger enclosures. Community composition was affected by metacommunity size across the full gradient, with a more even detritivore community in larger metacommunities, and taxonomic groups such as mosquitoes going locally extinct in smaller metacommunities. We were able to divide the effects of metacommunity size into aquatic and terrestrial habitat components and found that the importance of each varied by species; those with simple life cycles were only affected by local aquatic habitat whereas insects with complex life cycles were also affected by the amount of terrestrial matrix. This differential survival of obligate and non-obligate dispersers allowed us to partition the beta-diversity between metacommunities among functional groups. Our study is one of the first tests of metacommunity size in a natural metacommunity landscape and shows that both diversity and community composition are significantly affected by metacommunity size. Synthesis Natural food webs are sensitive to meta-community size, i.e. the number of patches connected through dispersal. We provide an empirical test using the aquatic foodweb associated within bromeliads as a model system. When we reduced the number of bromeliad patches connect through dispersal, we found a clear change of the foodweb in terms of population sizes, beta diversity, community composition and predator-prey ratios. The response of individual taxa was predictable based on species traits including dispersal modes, life cycle, and adult resource requirements. Our study demonstrates that community structure is strongly influenced by the interplay of species traits and landscape properties. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

Home-range estimations have generally been disregarded as a means of quantifying habitat use and availability. Seasonal habitat use of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) calculated from a home-range estimator using an adaptive kernel method was compared with relocation point data from Sand Lake National Wildlife Refuge, South Dakota from 1 January 1993 to 27 June 1994, to determine if an adaptive kernel home-range estimator approximates traditional methods of quantifying habitat use. No differences between proportional area of seasonal home-ranges and point data were detected (P {\textgreater}0.05), indicating that habitat use calculated from an adaptive kernel home-range estimate was similar to habitat use calculated from relocation points. Potential benefits of home-range estimations include consideration of radio-telemetry error, biological independence of observations, and complete utilisation distributions. Given the success of home-range estimators at quantifying habitat use, a new alternative to habitat use analysis is offered. In situations where inherent telemetry error is unavoidable, using proportional area of home-range contours to define habitat use avoids the pitfalls associated with telemetry relocation point data.},

abstract = {Several stochastic models have tried to capture the architecture of food webs. This approach is interesting, but it is limited by the fact that different assumptions can yield similar results. To overcome this limitation, we develop a purely statistical approach. Body size in terms of an optimal ratio between prey and predator is used as explanatory variable. In 12 observed food webs, this model predicts, on average, 20{\%} of interactions. To analyze the unexplained part, we introduce a latent term: each species is described by two latent traits, foraging and vulnerability, that represent nonmeasured characteristics of species once the optimal body size has been accounted for. The model now correctly predicts an average of 73{\%} of links. The key features of our approach are that latent traits quantify the structure that is left unexplained by the explanatory variable and that this quantification allows a test of whether independent biological information, such as microhabitat use, camouflage, or phylogeny, explains this structure. We illustrate this method with phylogeny and find that it is linked to one or both latent traits in nine of 12 food webs. Our approach opens the door to the formulation of more complex models that can be applied to any kind of biological network. {\textcopyright} 2010 by The University of Chicago.},

abstract = {Food webs are highly complex ecological networks, dynamic in both space and time. Metacommunity models are now at the core of unified theories of biodiversity, but to date they have not addressed food web complexity. Here we show that metacommunity theory can explain the emergence of species-rich food webs with complex network topologies. Our analysis shows that network branching in the food web is maximized at intermediate colonization rates and limited dispersal scales, which also leads to concomitant peaks in species diversity. Increased food web complexity and species diversity are made possible by the structural role played by network branches that are supported by omnivore and generalist feeding links. Thus, in contrast to traditional food web theory, which emphasizes the destabilizing effect of omnivory feeding in closed systems, metacommunity theory predicts that these feeding links, which are commonly observed in empirical food webs, play a critical structural role as food webs assemble in space. As this mechanism functions at the metacommunity level, evidence for its operation in nature will be obtained through multiscale surveys of food web structure. Finally, we apply our theory to reveal the effects of habitat destruction on network complexity and metacommunity diversity.},

abstract = {We present a graph theoretic model of analysing food web structure called regular equivalence. Regular equivalence is a method for partitioning the species in a food web into "isotrophic classes" that play the same structural roles, even if they are not directly consuming the same prey or if they do not share the same predators. We contrast regular equivalence models, in which two species are members of the same trophic group if they have trophic links to the same set of other trophic groups, with structural equivalence models, in which species are equivalent if they are connected to the exact same other species. Here, the regular equivalence approach is applied to two published food webs: (1) a topological web (Malaysian pitcher plant insect food web) and (2) a carbon-flow web (St. Marks, Florida seagrass ecosystem food web). Regular equivalence produced a more satisfactory set of classes than did the structural approach, grouping basal taxa with other basal taxa and not with top predators. Regular equivalence models provide a way to mathematically formalize trophic position, trophic group and trophic niche. These models are part of a family of models that includes structural models used extensively by ecologists now. Regular equivalence models uncover similarities in trophic roles at a higher level of organization than do the structural models. The approach outlined is useful for measuring the trophic roles of species in food web models, measuring similarity in trophic relations of two or more species, comparing food webs over time and across geographic regions, and aggregating taxa into trophic groups that reduce the complexity of ecosystem feeding relations without obscuring network relationships. In addition, we hope the approach will prove useful in predicting the outcome of predator-prey interactions in experimental studies. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

I examined the degree to which Daphnia pulex differ from small-bodied zooplankton in their effects on algal biomass, seston C:P and N:P, total nitrogen and total phosphorus. This was done with both survey data from natural ponds and an in situ experiment in which D. pulex was compared to a small zooplankton assemblage under low and high nutrient conditions and in two different ponds. D. pulex effects on algae were only evident under high nutrient conditions. In natural ponds, D. pulex dominance resulted in a significantly weaker chlorophyll-total phosphorus relationship, with the divergence between D. pulex and small zooplankton-dominated systems being greatest in highly enriched ponds. In the experiment, D. pulex exerted stronger top-down control in enriched treatments only and tended to graze algae to lower levels in the more productive pond. Dynamics of C:P over the course of the experiment did not reveal strong effects of zooplankton composition. However, data on the final date of the experiment provided some evidence that D. pulex can enhance phosphorus limitation of algae; total phosphorus was lower and C:P higher in D. pulex treatments. Survey results revealed no effects of D. pulex on seston C:P or N:P, suggesting that this species may not be an important factor governing phosphorus limitation of algae in natural ponds.},

abstract = {Predicting ecosystem response to chemicals is a complex problem in ecotoxicology and a challenge for risk assessors. The variables potentially influencing chemical fate and exposure define the exposure scenario while the variables determining effects at the ecosystem level define the ecological scenario. In absence of any empirical data, the objective of this paper is to present simulations by a fugacity-based fate model and a differential equation-based ecosystem model to theoretically explore how direct and indirect effects on invertebrate shallow pond communities vary with changing ecological and exposure scenarios. These simulations suggest that direct and indirect effects are larger in mesotrophic systems than in oligotrophic systems. In both trophic states, interaction strength (quantified using grazing rates) was suggested a more important driver for the size and recovery from direct and indirect effects than immigration rate. In general, weak interactions led to smaller direct and indirect effects. For chemicals targeting mesozooplankton only, indirect effects were common in (simple) food-chains but rare in (complex) food-webs. For chemicals directly affecting microzooplankton, the dominant zooplankton group in the modelled community, indirect effects occurred both in food-chains and food-webs. We conclude that the choice of the ecological and exposure scenarios in ecotoxicological modelling efforts needs to be justified because of its influence on the prevalence and magnitude of the predicted effects. Overall, more work needs to be done to empirically test the theoretical expectations formulated here.},

abstract = {Aquatic ecologists use mesocosm experiments to understand mechanisms driving ecological processes. Comparisons across experiments, and extrapolations to larger scales, are complicated by the use of mesocosms with varying dimensions. We conducted a mesocosm experiment over a volumetric scale spanning five orders of magnitude (from 4 L to whole ponds) to determine the generality of algal responses to nutrient enrichment. Recognising that mesocosm dimensions may affect algal growth, we also manipulated the ratio of mesocosm surface area to volume (SA V) over two levels (high versus low). We used mesocosm tanks of similar size and construction to those commonly used in aquatic experiments to increase the generality of our results.2.Volume was generally a stronger determinant of algal responses than mesocosm shape (i.e. SA V). However, the effects of both volume and shape on algae were weak and explained a small portion of the variance in response variables. In addition, there was no consistent, directional relationship (positive or neutral) between mesocosm volume and algal abundance (estimated by chlorophyll concentration). Combined, our findings suggest that results from small-scale experiments, examining the direct response of algae to nutrient enrichment, can probably be 'moved on up' and applied to larger, more natural aquatic systems.3.Algal response to nutrient enrichment (e.g. nutrient use efficiency and effect size) varied strongly with time. This underscores the importance of choosing an experimental timescale appropriate to the biological and/or ecological process of interest.4.We compared our results to those from a recent meta-analysis of nutrient-limitation studies that included 359 freshwater pelagic experiments, spanning a wide range of volumetric and temporal scales. Similar findings between this experiment and the meta-analysis indicate that algal response to nutrient enrichment varies little across spatial scales. Therefore, it is probable that results from small-scale pelagic algal nutrient-limitation experiments are relevant to large-scale processes, such as eutrophication. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Understanding the structure of these networks is one of the outstanding challenges in the study of complex systems. Here we describe a general technique for detecting structural features in large-scale network data that works by dividing the nodes of a network into classes such that the members of each class have similar patterns of connection to other nodes. Using the machinery of probabilistic mixture models and the expectation-maximization algorithm, we show that it is possible to detect, without prior knowledge of what we are looking for, a very broad range of types of structure in networks. We give a number of examples demonstrating how the method can be used to shed light on the properties of real-world networks, including social and information networks. {\textcopyright} 2007 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Explaining the structure of ecosystems is one of the great challenges of ecology. Simple models for food web structure aim at disentangling the complexity of ecological interaction networks and detect the main forces that are responsible for their shape. Trophic interactions are influenced by species traits, which in turn are largely determined by evolutionary history. Closely related species are more likely to share similar traits, such as body size, feeding mode and habitat preference than distant ones. Here, we present a theoretical framework for analyzing whether evolutionary history-represented by taxonomic classification- provides valuable information on food web structure. In doing so, we measure which taxonomic ranks better explain species interactions. Our analysis is based on partitioning of the species into taxonomic units. For each partition, we compute the likelihood that a probabilistic model for food web structure reproduces the data using this information. We find that taxonomic partitions produce significantly higher likelihoods than expected at random. Marginal likelihoods (Bayes factors) are used to perform model selection among taxonomic ranks. We show that food webs are best explained by the coarser taxo-nomic ranks (kingdom to class). Our methods provide a way to explicitly include evolutionary history in models for food web structure. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Royal Society.},

More and more studies on pollination, mutualism and facilitation are published but these effects are interpreted more like alternative explanations than being synthesized with results of trophic analyses. Here, we construct and analyze the interaction web of the well-studied Chesapeake Bay mesohaline ecosystem. By interaction web we mean a food web completed by a carefully selected set of non-trophic links. We quantify the interaction structure of the web and the positional importance of nodes by different network indices. We perform the suitable analyses for different variants of the network: combinations of direction, sign and weights, as well as considering also non-trophic links result in a set of webs of different information content. We also create a semi-quantitative variant of the web, in which only the order of magnitude of the mass flows are considered. The appropriate network indices for each web variant are calculated and compared. Finally, however our paper is primarily of methodological nature, we present some findings about the fish community of the Bay. We suggest that the multiple techniques presented here, adapted even from social network analysis, can help field conservation efforts by suggesting optimal preferences for data collection. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Natural ecological communities are continuously buffeted by a varying environment, often making it difficult to measure the stability of communities using concepts requiring the existence of an equilibrium point. Instead of an equilibrium point, the equilibrial state of communities subject to environmental stochasticity is a stationary distribution, which is characterized by means, variances, and other statistical moments. Here, we derive three properties of stochastic multispecies communities that measure different characteristics associated with community stability. These properties can be estimated from multispecies time-series data using first-order multivariate autoregressive (MAR(1)) models. We demonstrate how to estimate the parameters of MAR(1) models and obtain confidence intervals for both parameters and the measures of stability. We also address the problem of estimation when there is observation (measurement) error. To illustrate these methods, we compare the stability of the planktonic communities in three lakes in which nutrient loading and planktivorous fish abundance were experimentally manipulated. MAR(1) models and the statistical methods we present can be used to identify dynamically important interactions between species and to test hypotheses about stability and other dynamical properties of naturally varying ecological communities. Thus, they can be used to integrate theoretical and empirical studies of community dynamics.},

We investigated the capacity for assemblages of three freshwater invertebrate consumer species (Asellus aquaticus, Nemoura cinerea and Sericostoma personatum) from temperate (southern England) and boreal (northern Sweden) regions to respond to expected shifts in temperature and basal resources, and quantified rates of a key ecosystem process (leaf-litter decomposition). Predictions of assemblage metabolism, derived from allometric-body size and temperature scaling relationships, accounted for approximately 40{\%} of the variance in decomposition rates. Assemblage species composition accounted for further variance, but species richness per se had no discernible effect. Regional differences were evident in rates of leaf decomposition across temperature and resource manipulations, and in terms of the processing efficiency of temperate and boreal consumers of the same species (i.e. after correcting for body size and metabolic capacity), suggesting that intraspecific variation among local populations could modulate B-EF effects. These differences have implications for extrapolating how environmental warming and other aspects of climate change (e.g. species range shifts) might affect important drivers of ecosystem functioning over large biogeographical scales. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Losing a species from a community can cause further extinctions, a process also known as coextinction. The risk of being extirpated with an interaction partner is commonly inferred from a species' host-breadth, derived from observing interactions between species. But observational data suffers from imperfect detection, making coextinction estimates highly unreliable. To address this issue and to account for data uncertainty, we fit a hierarchical N-mixture model to individual-level interaction data from a mutualistic network. We predict (1) with how many interaction partners each species interacts (to indicate their coextinction risk) and (2) how completely the community was sampled. We fit the model to simulated interactions to investigate how variation in sampling effort, interaction probability, and animal abundances influence model accuracy and apply it to an empirical dataset of flowering plants and their insect visitors. The model performed well in predicting the number of interaction partners for scenarios with high abundances, but indicated high parameter uncertainty for networks with many rare species. Yet, model predictions were generally closer to the true value than the observations. Our mutualistic plant-insect community most closely resembled the scenario of high interaction rates with low abundances. Median estimates of interaction partners were frequently much higher than the empirical data indicate, but uncertainty was high. Our analysis suggested that we only detected 14-59{\%} of the flower-visiting insect species, indicating that our study design, which is common for pollinator studies, was inadequate to detect many species. Imperfect detection strongly affects the inferences from observed interaction networks and hence, host specificity, specialisation estimates and network metrics from observational data may be highly misleading for assessing a species' coextinction risks. Our study shows how models can help to estimate coextinction risk, but also indicates the need for better data (i.e., intensified sampling and individual-level observations) to reduce uncertainty.},

Here we show that a method for detecting compartments from the social networking science identified significant compartments in three of five complex, empirical food webs. Detection of compartments was influenced by food web resolution, such as interactions with weights. Because the method identifies compartmental boundaries in which interactions are concentrated, it is compatible with the definition of compartments. The method is rigorous because it maximizes an explicit function, identifies the number of non-overlapping compartments, assigns membership to compartments, and tests the statistical significance...},

However their full potential has yet to be realised because of the huge amount of resources required to construct them de novo. Consequently, the current catalogue of networks that are suitable for rigorous and comparative analyses and theoretical development still suffers from a lack of standardisation and replication.Here, we present a novel R function, WebBuilder, which automates the construction of food webs from taxonomic lists, and a dataset of trophic interactions. This function works by matching species against those within a dataset of trophic interactions, and 'filling in' missing trophic interactions based on these matches. We also present a dataset of over 20,000 freshwater trophic interactions, and use this and four well-characterised freshwater food webs to test the method.The WebBuilder function facilitates the generation of food webs of comparable quality to the most detailed published food webs, but at a fraction of the research effort or cost. Furthermore, it matched and often outperformed a selection of predictive models, which are currently among the best, in terms of capturing key properties of empirical food webs. The method is simple to use, systematic and, perhaps most importantly, reproducible, which will facilitate (re-) analysis and data sharing. Although developed and tested on a sample of freshwater food webs, this method could easily be extended to cover other types of ecological interactions (such as mutualistic interactions).},

abstract = {The metabolic costs of animal movement have been studied extensively under laboratory conditions, although frequently these are a poor approximation of the costs of operating in the natural, heterogeneous environment. Construction of "energy landscapes," which relate animal locality to the cost of transport, can clarify whether, to what extent, and how movement properties are attributable to environmental heterogeneity. Although behavioral responses to aspects of the energy landscape are well documented in some fields (notably, the selection of tailwinds by aerial migrants) and scales (typically large), the principles of the energy landscape extend across habitat types and spatial scales. We provide a brief synthesis of the mechanisms by which environmentally driven changes in the cost of transport can modulate the behavioral ecology of animal movement in different media,develop example cost functions for movement in heterogeneous environments, present methods for visualizing these energy landscapes, and derive specific predictions of expected outcomes from individual-to population and species-level processes. Animals modulate a suite of movement parameters (e.g., route, speed, timing of movement, and tortuosity) in relation to the energy landscape, with the nature of their response being related to the energy savings available. Overall,variation in movement costs influences the quality of habitat patches and causes nonrandom movement of individuals between them. This can provide spatial and/or temporal structure to a range of population-and species level processes, ultimately including gene flow.

abstract = {Recreational trampling damage of natural vegetation is an increasing problem in the global context and has the potential to impact on vegetation communities that are of high ecological and socio-economic interest. Wildflower tourism in the national parks of southwest Australia, a global biodiversity hotspot, has the potential to damage the flora on which it depends through trampling. Little research has been previously undertaken in these largely shrub-dominated communities to identify and quantify such impacts. This study is the first to do so, using observational studies of tourists, a descriptive study, and trampling experiments. The behaviours of independent tourists and tour groups were observed. Of the 213 independent visitors observed 41 visitors left trails to view flowers and in the process trampled vegetation. Vegetation height and cover were measured at three sites frequented by wildflower tourists. Vegetation height and cover declined in response to use by tourists. Trampling experiments, which relied on trampling treatments of 0, 30, 100, 200, 300/500 passes, where 0 passes represents the control, were applied at four sites. Trampling led to a significant reduction in vegetation height immediately post- treatment, for all treatments, with a non-significant recovery over time. Trampling also significantly reduced vegetation cover, with the resistance indices for these experimental sites ranging from 30 to 300 passes. Collectively these results illustrate the low resilience and resistance of these valued communities and the possible impacts of wildflower and other nature based tourism, through trampling. The paper concludes with suggested management strategies, which strongly emphasise the importance of education for the tourism industry and provide for international comparisons in regard to recreational trampling impacts on biodiverse shrub land communities.},

Whether top-down or bottom-up regulation prevails depends both on abiotic constraints on forage availability and body size, because size simultaneously affects the risk of predation of herbivores and their nutritional demands. Consequently, ecosystems composed of similar species can have different dynamics if they differ in resource supply. Here, we use large herbivore assemblages in African savanna ecosystems to develop a framework that connects environmental gradients and disturbance patterns with body size and trophic structure. This framework provides a model for understanding the functioning and diversity of ecosystems in general, and unifies how top-down and bottom-up mechanisms depend on common underlying environmental gradients. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

The number of microcrustacean and macroinvertebrate taxa and juvenile fish abundance and diversity were significantly greater in older streams. Microcrustacean diversity was related to the amount of instream wood and percent pool habitat, while the number of macroinvertebrate taxa was related to bed stability, amount of instream wood, and percent pool habitat. The percent contribution of Ephemeroptera to stream benthic communities increased significantly with stream age and the amount of coarse benthic organic matter. Juvenile Dolly Varden (Salvelinus malma) were dominant in the younger streams, but juvenile coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) abundance was greater in older streams associated with increased pool habitat. Upstream lakes significantly influenced channel stability, percent Chironomidae, total macroinvertebrate and meiofaunal abundance, and percent fish cover. Stable isotope analyses indicated nitrogen enrichment from marine sources in macroinvertebrates and juvenile fish in older streams with established salmon runs. The findings are encapsulated in a conceptual summary of stream development that proposes stream assemblages to be determined by direct interactions with the terrestrial, marine, and lake ecosystems.},

Nonetheless, at global scales, we do not know what fraction of biodiversity consists of rare species. Here, we present the largest compilation of global plant diversity to quantify the fraction of Earth's plant biodiversity that are rare. A large fraction, {\~{}}36.5{\%} of Earth's {\~{}}435,000 plant species, are exceedingly rare. Sampling biases and prominent models, such as neutral theory and the k-niche model, cannot account for the observed prevalence of rarity. Our results indicate that (i) climatically more stable regions have harbored rare species and hence a large fraction of Earth's plant species via reduced extinction risk but that (ii) climate change and human land use are now disproportionately impacting rare species. Estimates of global species abundance distributions have important implications for risk assessments and conservation planning in this era of rapid global change.},

abstract = {Recreational trampling damage of natural vegetation is an increasing problem in the global context and has the potential to impact on vegetation communities that are of high ecological and socio-economic interest. Wildflower tourism in the national parks of southwest Australia, a global biodiversity hotspot, has the potential to damage the flora on which it depends through trampling. Little research has been previously undertaken in these largely shrub-dominated communities to identify and quantify such impacts. This study is the first to do so, using observational studies of tourists, a descriptive study, and trampling experiments. The behaviours of independent tourists and tour groups were observed. Of the 213 independent visitors observed 41 visitors left trails to view flowers and in the process trampled vegetation. Vegetation height and cover were measured at three sites frequented by wildflower tourists. Vegetation height and cover declined in response to use by tourists. Trampling experiments, which relied on trampling treatments of 0, 30, 100, 200, 300/500 passes, where 0 passes represents the control, were applied at four sites. Trampling led to a significant reduction in vegetation height immediately post- treatment, for all treatments, with a non-significant recovery over time. Trampling also significantly reduced vegetation cover, with the resistance indices for these experimental sites ranging from 30 to 300 passes. Collectively these results illustrate the low resilience and resistance of these valued communities and the possible impacts of wildflower and other nature based tourism, through trampling. The paper concludes with suggested management strategies, which strongly emphasise the importance of education for the tourism industry and provide for international comparisons in regard to recreational trampling impacts on biodiverse shrub land communities.},

abstract = {Understanding how ecological communities are structured and how this may vary between different types of ecosystems is a fundamental question in ecology. We develop a general framework for quantifying size-structure within and among different ecosystem types (e.g. terrestrial, freshwater or marine), via the use of a suite of bivariate relationships between organismal size and properties of individuals, populations, assemblages, pair-wise interactions, and network topology. Each of these relationships can be considered a dimension of size-structure, along which real communities lie on a continuous scale. For example, the strength, slope, or elevation of the body mass-versus-abundance or predator size-versus-prey size relationships may vary systematically among ecosystem types. We draw on examples from the literature and suggest new ways to use allometries for comparing among ecosystem types, which we illustrate by applying them to published data. Finally, we discuss how dimensions of size-structure are interconnected and how we could approach this complex hierarchy systematically. We conclude: (1) there are multiple dimensions of size-structure; (2) communities may be size-structured in some of these dimensions, but not necessarily in others; (3) across-system comparisons via rigorous quantitative statistical methods are possible, and (4) insufficient data are currently available to illuminate thoroughly the full extent and nature of differences in size-structure among ecosystem types. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.},

abstract = {Introduction: Food webs have aroused interest and scientific analysis for many decades (Cohen, 1978). Especially Odum's school of ecosystem thinking sought to quantify fluxes in ecosystems, based on feeding guilds (Odum, 1953). Later, the theoretical analysis of interactions among species took a prominent role, arguing that information fluxes are as important as energy fluxes (Pimm, 1982). These interaction-network ideas still dominate models and experiments today (Rossberg, 2013). In contrast, interactions between two (trophic) levels (“bipartite” or “two-mode” networks) are a more recent ecological mainstream activity. Pollination networks featured verbally in early scientific works (dating back to comments in the third chapter of Darwin, 1859), but it was only in the 1980s that data describing such interaction networks specifically received analytical attention (starting with the work of Jordano, 1987). Today, food-web ecologists and network ecologists are still two largely separate scientific communities, with different data, methods, aims, and interpretations. Attempts to bridge this gap are relatively few (Ings et al., 2009). Any food-web workshop will typically bring together people from both sides and those already straddling the fields. Still, studies show a considerable separation, despite substantial intellectual overlap. In this chapter, we present an (necessarily incomplete) overview of current differences between food-web and network ecology with the aim of highlighting the underlying similarities. We believe that both fields can profit from the expertise and experience present in the other, and we suggest specific steps toward incorporating so far neglected issues tackled in the other field. Specifically, we organize this chapter into four main dimensions (scientific focus; data; nodes and links; and methods) after a brief section defining the terms we use. Definitions Food webs describe who-eats-whom-relationships in an n × n adjacency matrix. Since every food-web entity may interact with any other, this matrix has the dimensions of the number of entities (species, guilds) and is called one-mode or unipartite. If interactions are restricted to those between, and not among, two trophic levels, the resulting k × l matrix describes bipartite networks. Food webs are typically interpreted along trophic relationships (and often contain only data on trophic interactions, as revealed, e.g., in the 113 webs in http://ipmnet.org/loop/foodweb.aspx). Interaction networks, in contrast, include a large diversity of relationships between species, e.g., mutualism, facilitation, or commensalism (Figure 1.1).},

The first warm spell, 1930–1960, stands out as a period of substantial faunal change. However, in addition to climate warming, suggested drivers of change include land use and other anthropogenic factors.

The levels of disturbance experienced by birds in the UK are difficult to estimate but the available evidence suggests that they could be considerable, with significant implications for bird conservation. This paper addresses three sources of disturbance to birds in the UK: from recreational pursuits; developments (construction and operation); and hunting. 2. Legislative requirements to take account of disturbance impacts are increasing but there has been little research to provide a sound scientific basis for impact assessment. A review of studies of the effects of disturbance on birds between 1970 and the present reveals considerable scope for improvement in the way in which results of research are applied. Disturbance effects (e.g. local site movements) and disturbance impacts (where a population is affected) are often confused. 3. Three example studies are reviewed which may point the way forward. The first takes a multivariate approach to assess the influence of disturbance on the use of sites by birds; the second takes an experimental approach by manipulating the source of disturbance; the third takes a modelling approach to establish metapopulation impacts of disturbance. 4. From this analysis, an outline of research priorities at local, regional and flyway scales is proposed.},

abstract = {Species diversity, and the various interactions that occur between species, supports ecosystems functioning and benefit human societies. Monitoring the response of species interactions to human alterations of the environment is thus crucial for preserving ecosystems. Ecological networks are now the standard method for representing and simultaneously analyzing all the interactions between species. However, deciphering such networks requires considerable time and resources to observe and sample the organisms, to identify them at the species level and to characterize their interactions. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, combined with network learning and modelling, can help alleviate these constraints. They are essential for observing cryptic interactions involving microbial species, as well as short-term interactions such as those between predator and prey. Here, we present three case studies, in which species associations or interactions have been revealed with NGS. We then review several currently available statistical and machine-learning approaches that could be used for reconstructing networks of direct interactions between species, based on the NGS co-occurrence data. Future developments of these methods may allow us to discover and monitor species interactions cost-effectively, under various environmental conditions and within a replicated experimental design framework. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

Central is beta-diversity - the component of regional diversity that accumulates from compositional differences between local species assemblages. We review how beta-diversity is impacted by human activities, including farming, selective logging, urbanization, species invasions, overhunting, and climate change. Beta-diversity increases, decreases, or remains unchanged by these impacts, depending on the balance of processes that cause species composition to become more different (biotic heterogenization) or more similar (biotic homogenization) between sites. While maintaining high beta-diversity is not always a desirable conservation outcome, understanding beta-diversity is essential for protecting regional diversity and can directly assist conservation planning. Beta-diversity reveals the spatial scaling of diversity loss. Beta-diversity illuminates mechanisms of regional diversity maintenance.Human activities cause beta-diversity to increase, decrease, or remain unchanged.Conservation significance of beta-diversity shift depends on local diversity dynamics.},

The various mountain micro-climates provide a natural gradient for space-for-time substitution research that plant responses to climate change. In this study, we surveyed the plant community in term of species composition, diversity and biomass across 189 sites on a hill of the Tibetan Plateau and analysed the individual and integrated effects of soil temperature and moisture on the plant community. The results showed that, at the quadrat scale, there were decrease in richness of 1.08 species for every 1 °C increase in soil temperature and 3.56 species for every 10{\%} decrease in soil moisture. The integrated effects of increasing soil temperature and decreasing moisture are expected to lead to a rapid decrease in species richness. Biomass had no significant correlation with soil temperature but significantly decreased with soil moisture decreasing (p {\textless} 0.01). Biomass would decrease when soil moisture was below 20{\%}, no matter how the change of soil temperature. We also found that gramineae and perennial forbs were sensitive to climate change. With soil temperature increased, the proportion of gramineae increased, whereas the proportion of perennial forbs decreased. The integrated effects of soil temperature increasing and moisture decreasing caused a shift from sedge-controlled to gramineae-controlled communities in alpine meadow. This study not only enhances our understanding of mountain plant community dynamics under climate change, but also predicts the shift of vegetation response to climate change on high-elevation alpine meadow.},

abstract = {Climate change is driving a pervasive global redistribution of the planet's species. Species redistribution poses new questions for the study of ecosystems, conservation science and human societies that require a coordinated and integrated approach. Here we review recent progress, key gaps and strategic directions in this nascent research area, emphasising emerging themes in species redistribution biology, the importance of understanding underlying drivers and the need to anticipate novel outcomes of changes in species ranges. We highlight that species redistribution has manifest implications across multiple temporal and spatial scales and from genes to ecosystems. Understanding range shifts from ecological, physiological, genetic and biogeographical perspectives is essential for informing changing paradigms in conservation science and for designing conservation strategies that incorporate changing population connectivity and advance adaptation to climate change. Species redistributions present challenges for human well-being, environmental management and sustainable development. By synthesising recent approaches, theories and tools, our review establishes an interdisciplinary foundation for the development of future research on species redistribution. Specifically, we demonstrate how ecological, conservation and social research on species redistribution can best be achieved by working across disciplinary boundaries to develop and implement solutions to climate change challenges. Future studies should therefore integrate existing and complementary scientific frameworks while incorporating social science and human-centred approaches. Finally, we emphasise that the best science will not be useful unless more scientists engage with managers, policy makers and the public to develop responsible and socially acceptable options for the global challenges arising from species redistributions.},

abstract = {Understanding what determines species' geographic distributions is crucial for assessing global change threats to biodiversity. Measuring limits on distributions is usually, and necessarily, done with data at large geographic extents and coarse spatial resolution. However, survival of individuals is determined by processes that happen at small spatial scales. The relative abundance of coexisting species (i.e. ‘community structure') reflects assembly processes occurring at small scales, and are often available for relatively extensive areas, so could be useful for explaining species distributions. We demonstrate that Bayesian Network Inference (BNI) can overcome several challenges to including community structure into studies of species distributions, despite having been little used to date. We hypothesized that the relative abundance of coexisting species can improve predictions of species distributions. In 1570 assemblages of 68 Mediterranean woody plant species we used BNI to incorporate community structure into Species Distribution Models (SDMs), alongside environmental information. Information on species associations improved SDM predictions of community structure and species distributions moderately, though for some habitat specialists the deviance explained increased by up to 15{\%}. We demonstrate that most species associations (95{\%}) were positive and occurred between species with ecologically similar traits. This suggests that SDM improvement could be because species co-occurrences are a proxy for local ecological processes. Our study shows that Bayesian Networks, when interpreted carefully, can be used to include local conditions into measurements of species' large-scale distributions, and this information can improve the predictions of species distributions.},

abstract = {Humans are rapidly altering the diversity and composition of ecological communities by accelerating rates of species extinctions and introductions. These changes in diversity are not random and disproportionately involve the addition or extinction of predators. Theoretical and microcosm studies suggest predator removal may either increase or decrease ecosystem stability. Here we test whether the addition or removal of predators affects aggregate biomass stability in 40 experiments carried out in six different ecosystems. Predators did not alter the temporal variability of autotroph biomass, but significantly destabilized herbivore biomass. The effects of predators on herbivore biomass stability varied significantly among ecosystems, with benthic and pelagic lake systems showing the greatest shifts. Consequently, the addition of predators to communities, as occurs in many conservation efforts, biological control programmes and species introductions, may lead to more variable system dynamics.},

abstract = {The distributions of both the organismal and ecological diversity of Peru were evaluated through cartographic analyses in relationship to Peru's national system of protected areas. Also identified and mapped were areas so poorly known that they represent conservation information gaps, areas that cannot currently be evaluated, but which should not be overlooked. These methods revealed that the protected area system in Peru did not adequately protect either organismal or ecological diversity. In the short term, inclusion of unprotected priority areas in the national system is the best way to improve biological conservation. Over long time periods, it is also important to make decisions about the priority of areas that are information gaps. This study provides a useful point of comparison with other countries that are at different stages in the task of assembling biodiversity information. It was clear that i) the identified priority areas were important for national-level planning; ii) the drier and nonforested ecosystems seldom have been included in conservation efforts; iii) because degradation processes will constantly change, the conservation status of a particular area will also change and should not be confounded in the setting of priorities with the value of the biological diversity present; and iv) the identification of information gaps is the most transparent method for keeping decision-makers advised as to the limits of scientific knowledge on the distribution of biological diversity.},

abstract = {Climate change is driving a pervasive global redistribution of the planet's species. Species redistribution poses new questions for the study of ecosystems, conservation science and human societies that require a coordinated and integrated approach. Here we review recent progress, key gaps and strategic directions in this nascent research area, emphasising emerging themes in species redistribution biology, the importance of understanding underlying drivers and the need to anticipate novel outcomes of changes in species ranges. We highlight that species redistribution has manifest implications across multiple temporal and spatial scales and from genes to ecosystems. Understanding range shifts from ecological, physiological, genetic and biogeographical perspectives is essential for informing changing paradigms in conservation science and for designing conservation strategies that incorporate changing population connectivity and advance adaptation to climate change. Species redistributions present challenges for human well-being, environmental management and sustainable development. By synthesising recent approaches, theories and tools, our review establishes an interdisciplinary foundation for the development of future research on species redistribution. Specifically, we demonstrate how ecological, conservation and social research on species redistribution can best be achieved by working across disciplinary boundaries to develop and implement solutions to climate change challenges. Future studies should therefore integrate existing and complementary scientific frameworks while incorporating social science and human-centred approaches. Finally, we emphasise that the best science will not be useful unless more scientists engage with managers, policy makers and the public to develop responsible and socially acceptable options for the global challenges arising from species redistributions.},

In temporary ponds, tadpole shrimps were recently identified as keystone predators, but the full extent of their ecosystem impact is still poorly known. Using a large-scale mesocosm experiment, we quantified the impact of different Triops cancriformis densities on ecosystem properties: water quality (including chlorophyll a as measure for phytoplankton biomass) and the diversity and structure of macrophyte and zooplankton communities. Mesocosms of 400 L (1 m2 surface) were lined with natural pond sediment of two study ponds differing in their natural Triops densities (Triops-rich and Triops-poor pond) and inundated to allow hatching from the egg bank. Afterwards, four Triops density treatments were established in the mesocosms: 0 (control), 5, 25 and 100 Triops per m2. After 13 weeks, the two highest Triops densities significantly influenced the ecosystem functioning not only by triggering changes in the diversity and composition of the pond communities but also by affecting water quality through bioturbation. These results confirm that tadpole shrimp can function as ecosystem engineers in temporary ponds and could promote a shift from a clear water to a turbid state through a series of trophic and non-trophic level effects.},

Although the topology of the Directed Web Graph encodes important information about the content of individual Web pages, it also reveals useful meta-level information about user communities. Random walk models are capable of propagating local link information throughout the Web Graph, which can be used to reveal hidden global relationships between different regions of the graph. Variations of these random walk models are shown to be effective at identifying latent Web communities and revealing link topology. To efficiently extract these communities from the stationary distribution defined by a random walk, we exploit a computationally efficient form of directed spectral clustering. The performance of our approach is evaluated in real Web applications, where the method is shown to effectively identify latent Web communities based on link topology only. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.},

abstract = {Groups of organisms often have congruent patterns of diversity or community structure due to similar environmental requirements. However, ecological interactions across trophic levels may also promote congruence independent of environmental drivers through selective predation, niche partitioning, or facilitation. We examined congruence between phytoplankton and zooplankton communities using 20 years of monitoring data from 17 Danish lakes, most of which were subject to external nutrient loading reduction after a period of eutrophication. Linear mixed effect models and partial Mantel tests were used to elucidate the extent to which congruence in genus richness and composition was driven by environmental factors. Congruence not explained by environmental controls might indicate ecological interactions across trophic levels of lake plankton. Genus richness and composition of phyto- and zooplankton were significantly congruent. Environmental factors had limited power to explain the genus richness of phyto- and zooplankton ( R2: 6{\%} and 12{\%}, respectively). Including richness of the reciprocal group among the predictors markedly improved each respective model and explanatory power ( R2: 11{\%} and 17{\%}, respectively). Similarly, a large proportion of the congruence in genus composition was independent of environmental dissimilarity (Mantel r: 0.29 and partial Mantel r after accounting for environmental control: 0.17). The strength of the congruence varied among different groups of phyto- and zooplankton, likely reflecting that the different zooplankton groups differ in their grazing size spectra and thus in the strength of their coupling with the phytoplankton assemblages. Remarkably, congruence with phytoplankton was strongest for the smallest group of zooplankton, rotifers, which graze on a limited size spectrum of phytoplankton. Moreover, congruence was stronger in low-nutrient lakes, suggesting that the strength of the interactions between the two groups weakens with eutrophication. This is likely due to changes in trophic dynamics, where enhanced fish predation on large-bodied zooplankton with increasing nutrient levels results in reduced zooplankton grazing control of phytoplankton assemblages.},

abstract = {Introduction Ecological networks represent a cornerstone of ecology: they describe and evaluate the links between form and function in multispecies systems, such as food-web structure and dynamics, and they connect different scales and levels of biological organization (Moore and de Ruiter, 2012; Wall et al., 2015). These properties of being able to elucidate both the structure within complex systems and their scaling indicate that ecological networks and network theory could be widely applied to practical problems, including management decision-making processes such as the design of nature reserves and the preservation of ecosystem services. While the study of networks – initially food-web compartments, then community assemblages, and more recently mutualistic networks – is now firmly embedded in ecology (Levins, 1974; Cohen, 1978; Hunt et al., 1987; Beare et al., 1992; Sol{\'{e}} and Montoya, 2001; Berlow et al., 2004; Moore et al., 2004; Cohen and Carpenter, 2005; Th{\'{e}}bault and Fontaine, 2010; Moore and de Ruiter, 2012; Pocock et al., 2012; Neutel and Thorne, 2014), the application of such approaches to managed ecosystems has lagged far behind. There are many explanations for this disconnection between agro-ecology and ecology, not least the pervasive view that because they are human managed and disturbed agro-systems are fundamentally “unnatural” and different from natural ecosystems: most ecologists prefer to study so-called natural ecosystems, even though most of these have in fact been heavily influenced by mankind for centuries either directly by local activity or indirectly by long-distance pollution. Network approaches have rarely been applied to agriculture and forestry, which is perhaps surprising given that much of the early, integrated management research (e.g., from the seminal works by Von Carlowitz, 1713, and Von Liebig, 1840, onwards) and the study of networks that stimulated major advances in ecological theory was grounded in attempts to improve agricultural and timber production (Wardle, 2002; Schr{\"{o}}ter et al., 2003; Coleman et al., 2004; Moore and de Ruiter, 2012, and the references therein). The last two decades have seen a hiatus in advances in agro-ecology in this area, while new network theory and empirical studies have elucidated the roles of body size in ecosystems and the study of plant–pollinator networks and other mutualistic webs have redefined our understanding of general ecology.},

abstract = {We investigated the effects of differing spatial scales of seagrass habitat architecture on the composition and abundance of settling bivalves in a sub-tropical seagrass community. The density of newly settled bivalves was generally greater at Thalassia testudinum grass bed edge (, 1 m) compared to interior portions of the bed (. 10 m). Deviation from this generalized pattern occurred when high densities of newly settled tulip mussels (Modiolus americanus) were recorded from the interior of the meadow, associated with aggregations of adult mussels. Bivalve settling densities appear to reflect settlement shadows of passively delivered larvae, bedload transport of newly settled individuals from unvegetated regions, as well as gregarious settlement among adult conspecifics. We also investigated the impact of seagrass patch shape and size on settlement by using artificial seagrass units (ASU) in separate short-term and long-term experiments. We found a positive relationship between ASU perimeter and bivalve abundance, suggesting that larval encounter rates with seagrass habitat may determine initial settlement patterns. Using ASUs we also investigated the relative role seagrass epiphytes play in determining the density of settling bivalves. Results showed greater settling densities where epiphytic secondary structure was elevated compared to controls, and bivalve density was significantly greater when ASUs were fouled with a natural community of epiphytes, suggesting that both microstructure and biofilms positively influenced bivalve settlement. We conclude that structural components of seagrass habitats increase bivalve settlement at multiple spatial scales, including epiphytic micro-structure, small-scale patch shape and size, and large-scale within habitat differences.},

abstract = {Anticipating the effect of climate change on biodiversity, in particular on changes in community composition, is crucial for adaptive ecosystem management but remains a critical knowledge gap. Here, we use climate velocity trajectories, together with information on thermal tolerances and habitat preferences, to project changes in global patterns of marine species richness and community composition under IPCC Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. Our simple, intuitive approach emphasizes climate connectivity, and enables us to model over 12 times as many species as previous studies. We find that range expansions prevail over contractions for both RCPs up to 2100, producing a net local increase in richness globally, and temporal changes in composition, driven by the redistribution rather than the loss of diversity. Conversely, widespread invasions homogenize present-day communities across multiple regions. High extirpation rates are expected regionally (for example, Indo-Pacific), particularly under RCP8.5, leading to strong decreases in richness and the anticipated formation of no-analogue communities where invasions are common. The spatial congruence of these patterns with contemporary human impacts highlights potential areas of future conservation concern. These results strongly suggest that the millennial stability of current global marine diversity patterns, against which conservation plans are assessed, will change rapidly over the course of the century in response to ocean warming.},

This could alter energy fluxes3–5 and even amplify extinction rates within the food web6–8.

Here, we tested this hypothesis by characterizing around 50,000 directly observed feeding interactions across 14 naturally heated stream ecosystems11–15. We found that higher temperature simplified food-web structure and shortened the pathways of energy flux between consumers and resources. A simple allometric diet breadth model10,16 predicted 68–82{\%} of feeding interactions and the effects of warming on key food-web properties. We used model simulations to identify the underlying mechanism as a change in the relative diversity and abundance of consumers and their resources. This model shows how warming can reduce the stability of aquatic ecosystems by eroding the structural integrity of the food web. Given these fundamental drivers, such responses are expected to be manifested more broadly and could be predicted using our modelling framework and knowledge of how warming alters some routinely measured characteristics of organisms.},

We compared three quantitative methods for choosing 5{\%} (an arbitrary figure) of all the 10 x 10 km grid cells in Britain to represent the diversity of breeding birds: (1) hotspots of richness, which selects the areas richest in species; (2) hotspots of range-size rarity (narrow endemism), which selects areas richest in those species with the most restricted ranges; and (3) sets of complementary areas, which selects areas with the greatest combined species richness. Our results show that richness hotspots contained the highest number of species-in-grid-cell records (with many representations of the more widespread species), whereas the method of complementary areas obtained the lowest number. However, whereas richness hotspots included representation of 89{\%} of British species of breeding birds, and rarity hotspots included 98{\%}, the areas chosen using complementarity represented all the species, where possible, at least six times over. The method of complementary areas was also well suited to supplementing the existing conservation network. For example, starting with grid cells with over 50{\%} area cover by existing "Sites of Special Scientific Interest," we searched for a set of areas that could complete the representation of all the most threatened birds in Britain, the Red Data species. The method of complementary areas distinguishes between irreplaceable and flexible areas, which helps planners by providing alternatives for negotiation. This method can also show which particular species justify the choice of each area. Yet the complementary areas method will not be fully able to select the best areas for conservation management until we achieve integration of some of the more important factors affecting viability, threat, and cost.},

abstract = {We studied the consequences of projected climate change on biome distribution in South America in the 21st century by forcing a potential vegetation model with climate scenarios from 15 climate models for two emission scenarios (A2 and B1). This analysis was carried out for the savanna and tropical forest biomes, which are the predominant biomes in tropical South America. In both scenarios, the results indicate reduction of tropical forest cover areas which would be replaced by savannas. This reduction of tropical forests increases with the time through the end of the 21st century, mostly over southeastern Amazonia. Considering the biome changes from current potential vegetation in the case when at least 75{\%} of the calculations agree on the projected biome change (consensus), the decrease of the tropical forest area in South America is 3{\%} for the period 2020-2029, 9{\%} for 2050-2059 and 18{\%} for 2090-2099 for the A2 emission scenario.

The aim of this article is to propose a quantification of the sedimentary volume in lagoon marshes on the long-, medium- and short-term, to precise the respective part of the natural and human factors driving the sedimentary changes, and to put in perspective the results with the predictions on the rise of sea level. The environmental analysis is based on a set of botanical, morpho-sedimentary and chronological (14C, 137Cs, 210Pb, 226Ra) indicators, on the use of surface marks to measure the vertical growth of saltmarshes, and on the photo-interpretation. Results show that the present available volume of fine-grained sediments represents ∼1,549,215 m3. The muddy deposits are concentrated both in the upstream (30{\%}) and downstream (63{\%}) part of the CDSA. The pluri-secular accretion rates (0.4 mm/a between 1681 BC and AD 2001) obtained in the Holocene Ludo ria are relatively low, compared with the pluri-10-year accretion rates (8-9 mm/a between AD 1941 and AD 2000) calculated from the excess 210Pb and 137Cs activity concentrations. On the short-term (AD 2000-2002), the measures of accretion rates confirm field observations, namely a critical situation where saltmarshes are in dominant erosion. Changes in sedimentary secular trend, spatial heterogeneity of present accretionary deficit and preservation potential of the CDSA marshes are discussed. {\textcopyright}2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The services of ecological systems and the natural capital stocks that produce them are critical to the functioning of the Earth's life-support system. They contribute to human welfare, both directly and indirectly, and therefore represent part of the total economic value of the planet. We have estimated the current economic value of 17 ecosystem services for 16 biomes, based on published studies and a few original calculations. For the entire biosphere, the value (most of which is outside the market) is estimated to be in the range of US{\$}16-54 trillion (10 12) per year, with an average of US{\$}33 trillion per year. Because of the nature of the uncertainties, this must be considered a minimum estimate. Global gross national product total is around US{\$}18 trillion per year. Because ecosystem services are not fully 'captured' in commercial markets or adequately quantified in terms comparable with economic services and manufactured capital, they are often given too little weight in policy decisions. This neglect may ultimately compromise the sustainability of humans in the biosphere. The economies of the Earth would grind to a halt without the services of ecological life-support systems, so in one sense their total value to the economy is infinite. However, it can be instructive to estimate the 'incremental' or 'marginal' value of ecosystem services (the estimated rate of change of value compared with changes in ecosystem services from their current levels). There have been many studies in the past few decades aimed at estimating the value of a wide variety of ecosystem services. We have gathered together this large (but scattered) amount of information and present it here in a form useful for ecologists, economists, policy makers and the general public. From this synthesis, we have estimated values for ecosystem services per unit area by biome, and then multiplied by the total area of each biome and summed over all services and biomes. Although we acknowledge that there are many conceptual and empirical problems inherent in producing such an estimate, we think this exercise is essential in order to: (1) make the range of potential values of the services of ecosystems more apparent; (2) establish at least a first approximation of the relative magnitude of global ecosystem services; (3) set up a framework for their further analysis; (4) point out those areas most in need of additional research; and (5) stimulate additional research and debate.

The community matrix is among ecology's most important mathematical abstractions, formally encapsulating the interconnected network of effects that species have on one another's populations. Despite its importance, the term "community matrix" has been applied to multiple types of matrices that have differing interpretations. This has hindered the application of theory for understanding community structure and perturbation responses. Here, we clarify the correspondence and distinctions among the Interaction matrix, the Alpha matrix, and the Jacobian matrix, terms that are frequently used interchangeably as well as synonymously with the term "community matrix." We illustrate how these matrices correspond to different ways of characterizing interaction strengths, how they permit insights regarding different types of press perturbations, and how these are related by a simple scaling relationship. Connections to additional interaction strength characterizations encapsulated by the Beta matrix, the Gamma matrix, and the Removal matrix are also discussed. Our synthesis highlights the empirical challenges that remain in using these tools to understand actual communities.},

abstract = {We used stable isotope analysis (15N/14N) to characterize the trophic relationships of consumer communities of an aquatic food web (a permanent pond) and the adjacent terrestrial food web (secondary dry dipterocarp forest) from a seasonal tropical field site in north-eastern Thailand. In general, isotopic signatures of aquatic vertebrates were higher ($\delta$15N range = 4.51-9.90‰) than those of invertebrates ($\delta$15N range = 1.10-6.00‰). High 15N signatures identified water snakes and swamp eels as top predators in the pond food web. In the terrestrial food web 15N signatures of saprophagous litter invertebrates (diplopods, earthworms), termites, ants and beetle larvae were lower than in those of predatory invertebrates (scolopendrids, scorpions, whip spiders). Predatory terrestrial frogs and caecilians had lower 15N signatures than snakes, indicating that snakes are among the top predators in the terrestrial web. Based on the distribution of isotopic signatures, we estimated five trophic levels for both the aquatic and terrestrial food web. The food chains of a seasonal tropical site studied were rather short, which implies similarities to the structure of temperate food webs.

The number of breeding terns increased significantly during the study period. Annual turnover rates varied from 0.16 to 0.30 (mean = 0.22, SD = ? 0.05), and were intermediate to low compared to those for other coastal-nesting terns, gulls (Larus spp.), and Black Skimmers (Rynchops niger). Reproductive success for the Least Tern col- onies in New Jersey averaged 0.48 young per pair (SD = +0.22). The causes of reproductive failure were similar among colonies, except that colonies with over 80 birds suffered higher losses due to predators than colonies with fewer than 80 birds. I suggest that the large, mainland colonies are more vulnerable to predators because they are more stable (making their presence known to predators) and predators have easy access. Human disturbance accounted for over half of the reproductive failures of Least Tern colonies. The low turnover rate and high loss to human activity suggest that reproductive success can be improved by increased protection.},

abstract = {Knowledge of species composition and their interactions, in the form of interaction networks, is required to understand processes shaping their distribution over time and space. As such, comparing ecological networks along environmental gradients represents a promising new research avenue to understand the organization of life. Variation in the position and intensity of links within networks along environmental gradients may be driven by turnover in species composition, by variation in species abundances and by abiotic influences on species interactions. While investigating changes in species composition has a long tradition, so far only a limited number of studies have examined changes in species interactions between networks, often with differing approaches. Here, we review studies investigating variation in network structures along environmental gradients, highlighting how methodological decisions about standardization can influence their conclusions. Due to their complexity, variation among ecological networks is frequently studied using properties that summarize the distribution or topology of interactions such as number of links, connectance, or modularity. These properties can either be compared directly or using a procedure of standardization. While measures of network structure can be directly related to changes along environmental gradients, standardization is frequently used to facilitate interpretation of variation in network properties by controlling for some co-variables, or via null models. Null models allow comparing the deviation of empirical networks from random expectations and are expected to provide a more mechanistic understanding of the factors shaping ecological networks when they are coupled with functional traits. As an illustration, we compare approaches to quantify the role of trait matching in driving the structure of plant–hummingbird mutualistic networks, i.e. a direct comparison, standardized by null models and hypothesis-based metaweb. Overall, our analysis warns against a comparison of studies that rely on distinct forms of standardization, as they are likely to highlight different signals. Fostering a better understanding of the analytical tools available and the signal they detect will help produce deeper insights into how and why ecological networks vary along environmental gradients.},

abstract = {Body size, trophic position (TP), and trophic niche width are important elements of food webs; however, there is still debate regarding their interrelationships. Most studies have tested these correlations using datasets restricted to carnivores and bivariate models that disregard potential indirect effects of other factors, their interactions, and phylogeny. We analyzed relationships among TP, consumer size, maximum food item size, food item size variation (a proxy for trophic niche width), and two other traits (gut length and mouth width) using confirmatory path analysis of an extensive dataset for freshwater fishes that encompass both carnivorous and non-carnivorous species. Consumer size was associated with maximum food size, food size variation, mouth width, and gut length, all of which mediated indirect relationships between body size and TP. Mouth gape was associated with maximum food size, and consumers that fed on larger food items had higher TP. Consumers with relatively long guts generally fed on small and homogeneous food items near the base of the food web. Models were consistent whether or not accounting for phylogeny, but varied according to trophic guilds. However, the body size of both carnivorous and non-carnivorous was not directly associated with TP. Therefore, the incorporation of functional traits and their intermediate pathways is critical for understanding size-based trophic relationships of animals that encompass diverse feeding strategies. Our results caution approaches that rely on body size as a surrogate for TP, especially in systems where plants and detritus are consumed directly by a significant number of animals, such as in most freshwater ecosystems.},

Our aim is to highlight areas of overlap and ambiguity between different role concepts and to describe how these roles can be used to group species according to different strategies (i.e., equivalence and functional roles). The existence of “gray areas” between role concepts make it essential for authors to carefully consider both which role concept(s) are most appropriate for the analyses they wish to conduct and what aspect of species' niches (if any) they wish to address.

Each species along these chains is responsible for passing energy to the taxa that follow it, and, as such, it is indispensable for their survival; because of this it is said to dominate them. The higher the number of species a node dominates, the greater the impact resulting from its removal. By computing dominator trees for 13 well-studied food webs we obtained for each of them the number of nodes dominated by a single species and the number of nodes that dominate each species. We illustrate the procedure for the Grassland Ecosystem showing the potential of this method for identifying species that play a major role in energy delivery and are likely to cause the greatest damage if removed. Finally, by means of two indices that measure error and attack sensitivity, we confirm a previous hypothesis that food webs are very robust to random loss of species but very fragile to the selective loss of the hubs. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

This precludes comparisons between sites where different techniques have been used. This paper discusses the variations between the methods that seem to be practiced currently and then describes a census of primates in the forests of western Uganda. Primate density and biomass varied greatly between forests as well as within forests and this is probably related to food availability. Chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) density was strongly correlated with nest encounter rates from reconnaissance walks in the forest. This result can be used to estimate chimpanzee density in forests where it is difficult to survey this species (e.g., due to security reasons). A total of 4,980 chimpanzee was estimated for Uganda which is higher than previously guessed, but still of conservation concern. Only four forests had more than 500 individuals which gives concern for long-term population viability.},

Different researchers use different methods to count chimpanzees. This brings to uncertainty when is the case to copmare different researches.
INTRODUCTION
Monitor populations is difficult because transects give data with a really wide error. A change in the population can be dected only if it is really big. 
Counting the primates is important because it gives us data about the importance of the habitat, their current number and the trend of their population. 
METHODS
The direct counting can be carried on through transects or teams of people. 
1) If the transect technique is used, the distance between the primates tends to overestimate them, but its still more trustuble than the viewver distance. 
2) Counting the number of groups can lead to biases in the counting of individuals
3) When you count a group you can count the middle of the group or otherwise the first animal that you see. If you count the first animal that you see, than you have to calculate the center of the group and suppose that the other animals are circularly distributed. 
The inderect way of counting primates is the following one:
you count the nests and then you consider the rate at which the nests decay and are built. Counting regularly the nests is way more trustable but really time expansive.

abstract = {Historical data on the distribution and status of the purple gallinule (Porphyrio porphyrio) in Portugal were collected by bibliographic research, from museum catalogues and from questionnaires to wetland managers, ornithologists and birdwatchers. The population suffered severe decline and range contraction at the end of the 19th century and most of the 20th century, due mainly to habitat loss and degradation and excessive hunting. However, the population has begun to recover in the last decade mainly through direct protection of the species and of the remaining habitat, together with creation of artificial wetlands and a reintroduction programme, and probably also due to immigration from Spain. The population size has increased about 10-fold and the range has expanded to most of its former area. The estimated Portuguese breeding population in 2002 was 49-67 pairs. Densities varied between 0.05 and 7 individuals/ha in recently colonized areas and stable (saturated) areas, respectively. Although the population is recovering, its small size, high fragmentation and several natural and anthropogenic threats lead us to consider it still a species of major concern in Portugal. {\textcopyright}2003 Elsevier Ltd.

annote = {The purple gallinule (Porphyrio porphyrio) was a really common wetland bird, wide spread around Europe, however, during the 20th century it has almost gone extinct (Cramp {\&} Simmons, 1980; S{\'{a}}nchez-Lafuente et al., 1992). 
Its habitats in the Mediterranean area are lowland freshwaters of brackish waters with abundant emerging vegetation such as reedmace, reeds and sedges (Cramp {\&} Simmons, 1980; del Hoyo et al., 1996; S{\'{a}}nchez-Lafuente et al., 1992; S{\'{a}}nchez-Lafuente et al., 2001). 
Even if the species is classified in the IUCN red list as globally non-threatened (del Hoyo et al., 1996, I can't find the book), the subspecies P. p. porphyrio is classified more locally as “rare” in Europe (Tucker and Heath, 1994) and “Endangered” in Portugal (Cabral et al., 1990, it is only in Portugese). 
During the 19th and 20th centuries, the population has experienced local extinction in continental Italy, Sicily, France, Greece and Balearic Islands and it almost got extinct in continental Spain, Sardinia and Portugal (Cramp and Simmons, 1980; Grussu, 1999; del Hoyo et al., 1996; S{\'{a}}nchez- Lafuente et al., 1992; Tucker and Heath, 1994). 


Conservation efforts aimed to reintroduce and protect the purple gallinule (with its habitats) (S{\'{a}}nchez-Lafuente et al., 2001) led to a recovery in the continental Spanish population in the 1970s and in the Sardinian population in the 1980s (Grussu, 1999; del Moral, 1997; S{\'{a}}nchez-Lafuente et al., 1992). 




France has reintroduced them in Corsica and in the South of France in 1990s (Canbrony and Aleman, 1996; Mathevet, 1997). 


The main threats to the purple gallinule have been the drainage of wetlands and excessive hunting (Pacheco {\&} McGregor, 2003). 


The recovery of the population is probably due to :
- The protection of the species since 1972 (Pacheco {\&} McGregor, 2003) 
- The creation of artificial habitats that suits them, for example lakes in golf courses. The lakes that were not big enough to support a breeding population served by facilitating dispersal and movement between breeding areas. They sometimes are used for a long period of time by juveniles and floaters (non-breeding birds) before they move to breeding sites. (Pacheco {\&} McGregor, 2003)

- Habitat saturation (the individuals are not able to find an alternative breeding area, so they breed all in the same site) brought some individuals from other areas to Portugal 
(pers. obs.; Ministro, J., pers. comm.). It also might have encouraged the local populations to don't move because they couldn't find any alternative breeding area (Newton, 1998) and have adopted the group breeding strategies (Brown, 1987). 


- The recolonization in the lower Mondego 

Even if the population is recovering, it is still really vulnerable to natural stochasticity and human disturbance. 
In 2004 the population was very small and highly fragmented, with 2/3 of its habitat holding five or less breeding pairs (Pacheco {\&} McGregor, 2004).},

abstract = {We assessed the effects of environmental variables on the distribution and feeding behaviour of adult Little Terns Sternula albifrons in Ria Formosa Natural Park, Algarve, southern Portugal, in different foraging habitats (main lagoon, salinas and sea) during the breeding seasons, April–July, of 2003–05. Foraging density was higher in the lagoon than in the sea, and at low tide. The number of foraging individuals at sea was independent of tide. Individual Little Terns foraged further from the nearest breeding colony in April and May (courtship feeding and incubation) than in June and July (chick-rearing). During intermediate tidal phases, individuals foraged further from the nearest colony, and followed main lagoon channels, perhaps because stronger currents increased prey availability. Diving activity and foraging success were higher in 2003 than 2004 or 2005, perhaps because of greater availability of marine prey in 2003. Diving rate was higher in July (when independent juveniles began learning how to forage) but diving success was higher in June (chick-rearing) than in other months. The variables selected by the final logistic models reflected four basic needs for the selection of feeding habitats by Little Terns: (1) association between foraging individuals, (2) areas with abundant feeding resources, (3) entrance channels and main lagoon channels with strong currents, and (4) the proximity to areas with alternative feeding resources, the salinas. Areas subjected to strong human pressure were avoided by foraging Little Terns.},
annote = {(Paiva, Ramos, Martins, Almeida, {\&} Carvalho, 2008)

Little terns forage within four km from their nest (Fasola {\&} Bogliani, 1990). This is why they are so susceptible to changes in food availability close to their nest (Paiva, Ramos, Martins, Almeida, {\&} Carvalho, 2008). They nest in habitats full of food so that they can spend less time and energy to forage, spending the saved energy for their nestlings (Paiva, Ramos, Martins, Almeida, {\&} Carvalho, 2008). Little terns tend to feed on the entrance of lagoons and lakes proably because rich of schools of fishes (Paiva, Ramos, Martins, Almeida, {\&} Carvalho, 2008). 
From April until June it's incubation and rearing time mad adults forage close to their nest (as cited in Paiva, Ramos, Martins, Almeida, {\&} Carvalho, 2008). In July the adults can forage further because the fledglings become to be able to fish (Paiva, Ramos, Martins, Almeida, {\&} Carvalho, 2008). The little terns fed mainly on the lagoon, on low tide, after fishes enter the lagoon during the intermediate tide (Paiva, Ramos, Martins, Almeida, {\&} Carvalho, 2008). However, little terns use also the inland up to 4 km inside (if the resources are scarce in the lagoon and on the seashore) and the seashore – especially adults (Paiva, Ramos, Martins, Almeida, {\&} Carvalho, 2008). The lagoon feeding is highly tide dependent; the seashore feeding is not (Paiva, Ramos, Martins, Almeida, {\&} Carvalho, 2008). 
Four are the factors that influence the feeding behaviour of the little terns (Paiva, Ramos, Martins, Almeida, {\&} Carvalho, 2008): 
1. the presence of other foraging individuals. It is present in the literature that most seabirds follow who's feeding because they know that they are going to find some food there (Ward {\&} Zahavi, 1973). 
2. the presence of food (lagoon feeding grounds {\&} shellfish collection areas). The fact that little terns feed where shellfish has been harvested can be explain this way: the substrate is disturbed, enriching it with nutrients, thereby increasing it local productivity. If this is true, the bivalves harvesting could be beneficial to little terns. 
3. the presence of main lagoon channels [the higher flow rate is associated with an higher abundance of preys]. Little terns invest a lot of energy in this. They travel far to reach this place. They could get to closer secondary channels, but this have a lower flow rate and present a less dense presence of fishes. 
4. the proximity of salinas [salinas have alternative sources of food]. Salinas have a more stable source of food. However, it is a low energy kind of food: shrimps. Furthermore, the shrimps are difficult to handle because of their appendages and often are refused by the chicks. 
5. the absence of humans. However, they can handle a little human presence such as a few small boats in the main channels and close to summer recreation areas. 
Which other species are little terns associated with? If we can protect the little tern, we can then protect also the other species that live close to them.},

abstract = {A major challenge in ecology is forecasting the effects of species' extinctions, a pressing problem given current human impacts on the planet. Consequences of species losses such as secondary extinctions are difficult to forecast because species are not isolated, but interact instead in a complex network of ecological relationships. Because of their mutual dependence, the loss of a single species can cascade in multiple coextinctions. Here we show that an algorithm adapted from the one Google uses to rank web-pages can order species according to their importance for coextinctions, providing the sequence of losses that results in the fastest collapse of the network. Moreover, we use the algorithm to bridge the gap between qualitative (who eats whom) and quantitative (at what rate) descriptions of food webs. We show that our simple algorithm finds the best possible solution for the problem of assigning importance from the perspective of secondary extinctions in all analyzed networks. Our approach relies on network structure, but applies regardless of the specific dynamical model of species' interactions, because it identifies the subset of coextinctions common to all possible models, those that will happen with certainty given the complete loss of prey of a given predator. Results show that previous measures of importance based on the concept of "hubs" or number of connections, as well as centrality measures, do not identify the most effective extinction sequence. The proposed algorithm provides a basis for further developments in the analysis of extinction risk in ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2009 Allesina, Pascual.},

abstract = {Migratory connectivity can have important consequences for individuals, populations and communities. We argue that most consequences not only depend on which sites are used but importantly also on when these are used and suggest that the timing of migration is characterised by synchrony, phenology, and consistency. We illustrate the importance of these aspects of timing for shaping the consequences of migratory connectivity on individual fitness, population dynamics, gene flow and community dynamics using examples from throughout the animal kingdom. Exemplarily for one specific process that is shaped by migratory connectivity and the timing of migration - the transmission of parasites and the dynamics of diseases - we underpin our arguments with a dynamic epidemiological network model of a migratory population. Here, we quantitatively demonstrate that variations in migration phenology and synchrony yield disease dynamics that significantly differ from a time-neglecting case. Extending the original definition of migratory connectivity into a spatio-temporal concept can importantly contribute to understanding the links migratory animals make across the globe and the consequences these may have both for the dynamics of their populations and the communities they visit throughout their journeys. Synthesis Migratory connectivity quantifies the links migrant animals make across the globe and these can have manifold consequences - from individual fitness, population dynamics, gene flow to transmission of pathogens and parasites. We show through the use of empirical examples and a conceptual model that these consequences not only depend on which sites are used but importantly also on when these are used. Therefore, we specify three dimensions of migration timing - phenology, synchrony and consistency, which describe the timing of migration 1) relative to development of key resources; 2) relative to the migration of other individuals; and 3) relative to previous migration events. Each of these dimensions can alter the consequences, but typically through different mechanisms.},

abstract = {Kernel home-range estimators are becoming more widely used to determine the home-range size for herpetofauna, despite the problems associated with selecting the appropriate smoothing factor. We used simulations to demonstrate the inconsistency of kernel estimators at determining the home-range size of random distributions. Furthermore, we used the positions of ten adult male Lampropeltis triangulum radio-tracked over two full active seasons (2003 and 2004) to demonstrate that the size of the home range increases significantly with an increase in the smoothing factor. The degree of increase, however, was not consistent between individuals. In addition, using least-squares cross-validation to select the smoothing factor produced a wide range of values for different individuals. Because of these inconsistencies, we suggest using the minimum convex polygon (MCP) method to calculate home-range size in studies of herpetofauna. When studying habitat use, however, we suggest using the MCP as the area of the home range and adjusting the smoothing factor until the area of the 95{\%} kernel equals the area of the MCP. This provides an objective method for selecting the smoothing factor. A LTHOUGH the exact definition of home range is still debated, a home range is generally accepted to be the area in which an individual performs its normal activities (Burt, 1943). There is little agreement, however, on how to quantify home-range size and, consequently , numerous methods have been employed (Powell, 2000). One of the most commonly used home-range estimators is the minimum convex polygon (MCP), which is the smallest possible convex polygon that encompasses all the known locations of a given individual (Hayne, 1949). The minimum convex polygon is widely used because it is simple to conceptualize and does not rely on the data having some underlying statistical distribution (Powell, 2000). Despite its wide use and simplicity, however, MCP only provides a crude outline of an individual's home range. It often includes large areas never used by the animal and ignores patterns of selection within the home range (Powell, 2000; Taulman and Seaman, 2000). To examine habitat selection within a home range, it is useful to employ estimators that quantify the intensity of use. Kernel home-range estimators are the most widely used for quantifying intensity of use because they are the most consistent and accurate of the methods available (Worton, 1989; Seaman and Powell, 1996). The kernel estimator is a non-parametric method that produces a distribution estimating the likelihood of finding the animal at any particular location within its home range (Worton, 1989), but it, like MCP, also includes areas never used by the animal. One drawback of this method is that the user must set numerous parameters, and the values of those parameters have a large effect on the size of the home range (Kazmaier et al., 2002). In particular, choosing the smoothing factor (h) of the kernel is the most important and difficult aspect of using kernels (Worton, 1989). Low values of h give nearby locations the greatest influence on the shape of the kernel, revealing small-scale detail, while large values allow more influence from distant locations, which reveals the outlying shape of the distribution (Seaman and Powell, 1996). Simulations have shown that even small changes in h can have a large effect on the size of the home range (Worton, 1995) and has led some researchers to the conclusion that kernels are more suited to analysis of use, rather than to the estimation of home-range size (Harris et al., 1990; Kazmaier et al., 2002). Other problems associated with the number of locations and the patterns of space use by individuals can also lead to variable estimates of home-range sizes when using kernels (Seaman et al., 1999; Blundell et al., 2001; Hemson et al., 2005). Despite the problems associated with estimating home-range size using kernel estimators, the issue is rarely addressed in studies of herpetofauna. To our knowledge, none of the studies using kernel estimators on reptiles or amphibians mentioned the problems associated with selecting the appropriate h (Rodriguez-Robles, 2003; Diffendorfer et al., 2005; Taylor et al., 2005), and some studies did not mention the method used to select h (Morrow et al., 2001; Tucker et al., 2001; Muths, 2003), which would prevent comparative studies. Methods for choosing h have been developed, and least-squares cross-validation (LSCV) is the},

We explored the relationships between antipredator behaviour (vocalisation, concealment, fleeing), detectability (colouration, group size) and social organisation in arboreal langurs. Three clear antipredation conditions emerged: (1) exemplified by Presbytis melalophos-brightly-coloured species (red, yellow) with contrasting colours, living in large unimale-multifemale groups ({\textgreater}10 individuals), that vocalised frequently and that flee loudly through the canopy; (2) exemplified by P. comata-greyish species (some contrasting colours), living in intermediate, unimale-multifemale or 1-male-1-female groups (approx. 7 individuals), that vocalise infrequently and that flee through the middle forest layers; (3) exemplified by P. frontata-dull-coloured species without contrast, living in small unimale-multifemale or 1-male-1-female groups ({\textless}5 individuals), that may freeze upon detection, and that may vocalise mainly during the night. Crypsis as an antipredator strategy is restricted to taxa that occur in 1-male-1-female groups.

abstract = {Functional traits are increasingly being used to predict extinction risks and range shifts under long-term climate change scenarios, but have rarely been used to study vulnerability to extreme climatic events, such as supraseasonal droughts. In streams, drought intensification can cross thresholds of habitat loss, where marginal changes in environmental conditions trigger disproportionate biotic responses. However, these thresholds have been studied only from a structural perspective, and the existence of functional nonlinearity remains unknown. We explored trends in invertebrate community functional traits along a gradient of drought intensity, simulated over 18 months, using mesocosms analogous to lowland headwater streams. We modelled the responses of 16 traits based on a priori predictions of trait filtering by drought, and also examined the responses of trait profile groups (TPGs) identified via hierarchical cluster analysis. As responses to drought intensification were both linear and nonlinear, generalized additive models (GAMs) were chosen to model response curves, with the slopes of fitted splines used to detect functional thresholds during drought. Drought triggered significant responses in 12 (75{\%}) of the a priori-selected traits. Behavioural traits describing movement (dispersal, locomotion) and diet were sensitive to moderate-intensity drought, as channels fragmented into isolated pools. By comparison, morphological and physiological traits showed little response until surface water was lost, at which point we observed sudden shifts in body size, respiration mode and thermal tolerance. Responses varied widely among TPGs, ranging from population collapses of non-aerial dispersers as channels fragmented to irruptions of small, eurythermic dietary generalists upon extreme dewatering. Our study demonstrates for the first time that relatively small changes in drought intensity can trigger disproportionately large functional shifts in stream communities, suggesting that traits-based approaches could be particularly useful for diagnosing catastrophic ecological responses to global change.},

abstract = {SUMMARY Attempts to gauge the biological impacts of climate change have typically focussed on the lower levels of organization (individuals to populations), rather than considering more complex multi-species systems, such as entire ecological networks (food webs, mutualistic and host–parasitoid networks). We evaluate the possibility that a few principal drivers underpin network-level responses to climate change, and that these drivers can be studied to develop a more coherent theoretical framework than is currently provided by phenomenologi-cal approaches. For instance, warming will elevate individual ectotherm meta-bolic rates, and direct and indirect effects of changes in atmospheric conditions are expected to alter the stoichiometry of interactions between primary con-sumers and basal resources; these effects are general and pervasive, and will permeate through the entire networks that they affect. In addition, changes in the density and viscosity of aqueous media could alter interactions among very small organisms and disrupt the pycnoclines that currently compartmentalize many aquatic networks in time and space. We identify a range of approaches and potential model systems that are particularly well suited to network-level studies within the context of climate change. We also highlight potentially fruitful areas of research with a view to improving our predictive power regarding climate change impacts on networks. We focus throughout on mech-anistic approaches rooted in first principles that demonstrate potential for application across a wide range of taxa and systems.},

abstract = {Our planet is changing at paces never observed before. Species extinction is happening at faster rates than ever, greatly exceeding the five mass extinctions in the fossil record. Nevertheless, our lives are strongly based on services provided by ecosystems, thus the responses to global change of our natural heritage are of immediate concern. Understanding the relationship between complexity and stability of ecosystems is of key importance for the maintenance of the balance of human growth and the conservation of all the natural services that ecosystems provide. Mathematical network models can be used to simplify the vast complexity of the real world, to formally describe and investigate ecological phenomena, and to understand ecosystems propensity of returning to its functioning regime after a stress or a perturbation. The use of ecological-network models to study the relationship between complexity and stability of natural ecosystems is the focus of this review. The concept of ecological networks and their characteristics are first introduced, followed by central and occasionally contrasting definitions of complexity and stability. The literature on the relationship between complexity and stability in different types of models and in real ecosystems is then reviewed, highlighting the theoretical debate and the lack of consensual agreement. The summary of the importance of this line of research for the successful management and conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services concludes the review.},

abstract = {Climate change would have profound influences on community structure and composition, and subsequently has impacts on ecosystem functioning and feedback to climate change. A field experiment with increased temperature and precipitation was conducted to examine effects of experimental warming, increased precipitation and their interactions on community structure and composition in a temperate steppe in northern China since April 2005. Increased precipitation significantly stimulated species richness and coverage of plant community. In contrast, experimental warming markedly reduced species richness of grasses and community coverage. Species richness was positively dependent upon soil moisture (SM) across all treatments and years. Redundancy analysis (RDA) illustrated that SM dominated the response of community composition to climate change at the individual level, suggesting indirect effects of climate change on plant community composition via altering water availability. In addition, species interaction also mediated the responses of functional group coverage to increased precipitation and temperature. Our observations revealed that both abiotic (soil water availability) and biotic (interspecific interactions) factors play important roles in regulating plant community structure and composition in response to climate change in the semiarid steppe. Therefore these factors should be incorporated in model predicting terrestrial vegetation dynamics under climate change. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Food web response to species loss has been investigated in several ways in the previous years. In binary food webs, species go secondarily extinct if no resource item remains to be exploited. In this work, we considered that species can go extinct before the complete loss of their resources and we introduced thresholds of minimum energy requirement for species survival. According to this approach, extinction of a node occurs whenever an initial extinction event eliminates its incoming links so it is left with an overall energy intake lower than the threshold value. We tested the robustness of 18 real food webs by removing species from most to least connected and considering different scenarios defined by increasing the extinction threshold. Increasing energy requirement threshold negatively affects food web robustness. We found that a very small increase of the energy requirement substantially increases system fragility. In addition, above a certain value of energy requirement threshold we found no relationship between the robustness and the connectance of the web. Further, food webs with more species showed higher fragility with increasing energy threshold. This suggests that the shape of the robustness-complexity relationship of a food web depends on the sensitivity of consumers to loss of prey. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {Every year, millions of households provide huge quantities of supplementary food to wild birds. While alteration of the natural dynamics of food supply represents a major intervention in avian ecology, we have a remarkably limited understanding of the impacts of this widespread pastime. Here, we examine the many and varied responses of birds to supplementary feeding at backyard feeders - in large-scale management projects and in focused academic studies - and evaluate population responses to the bird-feeding phenomenon. Our review encompasses a wide range of species, from songbirds to raptors, and compares provisioning with a variety of foods, at different times of year and in different locations. We consider positive impacts, such as aiding species conservation programs, and negative ones, such as increased risk of disease transmission. It seems highly likely that natural selection is being artificially perturbed, as feeding influences almost every aspect of bird ecology, including reproduction, behavior, demography, and distribution. As the effects of bird feeding cascade through ecosystems and interact with processes of environmental change, we suggest areas for future research and highlight the need for large-scale experiments, with a particular focus on the backyards of an increasingly urban and generous, but sometimes fickle, human population.},

abstract = {1. The sexual behaviour of a chimpanzee community in the Gombe National Park, Tanzania, was studied intensively for 16 months. Additional information came from 15 years of demographic and behavioural data accumulated by Jane Goodall and members of the Gombe Stream Research Centre. 2. The mating system of the Gombe chimpanzees is flexible and comprises three distinct mating patterns: (a) opportunistic, non-competitive mating, when an oestrous female may be mated by all the community males; (b) possessiveness, when a male forms a special short-term relationship with an oestrous female and may prevent lower-ranking males from copulating with her; and (c) consortships, when a male and a female leave the group and remain alone, actively avoiding other chimpanzees. While males took the initiative in possessive behaviour and consortships, females had to cooperate for a successful relationship to develop. 3. Data from 14 conceptions indicated that the majority of females (9) became pregnant while participating in the restrictive mating patterns, possessiveness and consorting. It could be established definitely that seven of these females were consorting during the cycle in which they conceived. As 73{\%} of the 1137 observed copulations occurred during opportunistic mating, 25{\%} during possessiveness, and only 2{\%} during consortships, there was no correlation between copulation frequency and reproductive success. 4. Adult males showed differential frequencies of participation in the restrictive mating patterns. Male age, dominance rank, and the amount of agonistic behaviour directed to females showed no correlation with participation in the restrictive mating patterns. The following male characteristics did show significant, positive correlations with involvement in the restrictive mating patterns: (a) the amount of time spent in the same group as oestrous females, (b) the proportion of that time spent grooming oestrous females in groups, and (c) the frequency with which males shared food with females. While dominance ranks of the adult males showed no consistent correlation with involvement in the restrictive mating patterns, it was clear that the most dominant male did gain an advantage. He was the only male able to monopolise oestrous females by showing possessive behaviour. 5. Consortships appeared to be the optimal reproductive strategy for males (with the exception of the most dominant) and females, as they gave males the highest probability of reproductive success, and allowed females to exercise choice. However, there appeared to be disadvantages associated with consort formation; the greatest of these was the increased risk of intercommunity encounters. While all individuals have the potential to practice each mating pattern, the strategy actually used at any moment will be determined by variables both within the individual, e.g. age, physical condition, dominance position; and by social factors in the group, e.g. general stability of male dominance relationships, presence of a strong alpha male, existence of special male-female relationships.},

These result from different degrees of species adaptations to changing biotic and abiotic conditions, and from differential range shifts of species. To determine whether the responses of organisms are determined by particular species traits and how species interactions and community dynamics are likely to be disrupted is a challenge.Here, we focus on two key traits: body size and ecological specialization.We present theoretical expectations and empirical evidence on how climate change affects these traitswithin communities. We then explore howthese traits predispose species to shift or expand their distribution ranges, and associated changes on community size structure, food web organization and dynamics.We identify three major broad changes: (i) Shift in the distribution of body sizes towards smaller sizes, (ii) dominance of generalized interactions and the loss of specialized interactions, and (iii) changes in the balance of strong andweak interaction strengths in the short term. We finally identify two major uncertainties: (i) whether largebodied species tend to preferentially shift their ranges more than small-bodied ones, and (ii) how interaction strengths will change in the long term and in the case of newly interacting species. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Understanding how management activities impact plant population dynamics is necessary to conserve at-risk species, control invasive species and sustainably harvest non-timber forest products (NTFP). For NTFP, knowledge about how the sustainability of harvest varies by plant life-form and part harvested is limited and needed to inform management of the thousands of species providing income to millions of people world-wide. Matrix population models are commonly used to generate management recommendations. We reviewed studies of 46 NTFP species that used matrix models and synthesize the current knowledge on harvest effects. For 19 species with harvested and control populations, we assessed the impacts of harvest on projected population growth rates ($\lambda$) using meta-analysis and analysed trends in population responses to harvest across species, life-forms and plant part harvested using elasticity and life table response experiment (LTRE) analyses, and the combination of both, to assess vulnerability to harvest. NTFP harvest significantly reduced $\lambda$ across species. On the scale of individual studies, however, $\lambda$ provided little information about harvest sustainability unless replication was sufficiently high. Most studies had low levels of replication over space or time and did not include contrasting levels of harvest. Whole-plant harvest of herbs and bark harvest from trees were not sustainable largely because of decreases in survival. Palm leaf or fruit harvest and rattan stem harvest were potentially sustainable. Combined elasticity-LTRE analysis was especially valuable in assessing the sustainability of harvest when differences in $\lambda$ between harvested and control populations were small, for studies with limited replicates, and where harvest effects varied regionally. Synthesis and applications. The use of matrix models to assess the impacts of NTFP harvest is still rare in regions where trade of wild plants is heaviest and for several commonly harvested life-forms. Given the high variance in estimates for most NTFP species, $\lambda$ does not provide a precise assessment of harvest impacts. We recommend that managers consider the combined elasticity-LTRE analysis in addition to $\lambda$ in making management decisions for NTFP. NTFP research that accounts for environmental drivers of population dynamics in addition to harvest should be prioritized. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {Keystone predators, by reducing the abundance of competitively superior prey, may have indirect positive effects on weak competitors, possibly increasing their abundance or preventing local competitive exclusion. By analogy to the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis, we would expect species diversity to peak at intermediate predator densities. In a replicated artificial pool experiment, we examined the relationships between density of the backswimmer Notonecta maculata (0, 1, 2, and 4 per 30 l pool) and invertebrate taxon diversity over an 11-week period of predator occupancy. Diversity reached high levels at high predator density sooner than at intermediate density. At the end of the experiment, taxon diversity was greatest at densities of 2 and 4 Notonecta per pool. While the overall predator density-diversity curve was in line with the intermediate disturbance hypothesis, the reduction in diversity from intermediate to high predator density was not statistically significant. Density of the preferred prey Daphnia magna decreased with Notonecta density, while densities of the smaller cladocerans Moina brachiata and Ceriodaphnia spp. increased. Suppression of Daphnia at high Notonecta densities may partially explain the increase in Moina and Ceriodaphnia densities. However, most of the relationship between Notonecta and the smaller cladocerans appears to be independent of Daphnia, suggesting complex interactions within the community. Our results suggest that keystone predation plays a strong role in structuring this community. Although diversity did not decrease significantly at the highest predator density as predicted, such a decrease may be more likely for pools with longer durations of predator occupancy or with higher predator densities. {\textcopyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {The study of food webs has been a central theme within ecology for decades, and their structure and dynamics have been used to assess a range of key properties of communities (e.g. complexity-stability relationships) and ecosystems (e.g. fluxes of energy and nutrients). However, many food web parameters are sensitive to sampling effort, which is rarely considered, and further, most studies have used either species- or size-averaged data for both nodes and links, rather than individual-based data, which is the level of organisation at which trophic interactions occur. This practice of aggregating data hides a considerable amount of biologically meaningful variation and could, together with potential sampling effects, create methodological artefacts. New individual-based approaches could improve our understanding of, and ability to predict, food web structure and dynamics, particularly if they are derived from simple metabolic and foraging constraints. We explored the effect of species-averaging in four highly-resolved individual-based aquatic food webs (Broadstone Stream, the Afon Hirnant, Tadnoll Brook and the Celtic Sea) and found that it obscured structural regularities resulting from intraspecific size variation. The individual-based approach provided clearer insights into seasonal and ontogenetic shifts, highlighting the importance of the temporal component of size-structuring in ecological networks. An extension of the Allometric Diet Breadth Model predicted the structure of the empirical food webs almost twice as accurately as the equivalent species-based webs, with the best-fitting model predicting 83{\%} of the links correctly in the Broadstone Stream size-based web, and the few mismatches between the model and data were explained largely by sampling effects. Our results highlight the need for theoretical explanations to correspond closely with methods of data collection and aggregation, which is the exception rather than the rule at present. We suggest how this situation can be improved by including individual-level data and more explicit information on sampling effort when constructing food webs in future studies. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {This paper describes the breeding population, breeding habitats and reproductive variables of Little Terns Sterna albifrons in natural (sandy beaches) and alternative (salinas) habitats. Studies of nesting success conducted between 1998 and 2002 in these two types of habitat were combined with a literature review of census work from the past 30 years in order to assess whether salinas are suitable alternative breeding habitat for Little Terns. Most of the Portuguese Little Tern population now breeds in salinas. Census data from the last 30 years show that this is a recent breeding behaviour, because until the 1990s most colonies were located on sandy beaches. Destruction and disturbance of the natural habitat has caused this habitat shift. Despite this shift, the Portuguese Little Tern breeding population did not decline during this period and no significant differences were found in nesting success between natural and alternative habitats. This might indicate that salinas are a suitable alternative breeding habitat for Little Terns, but differences in laying period, clutch size and egg size were recorded between birds nesting on sandy beaches and in salinas in the same area. Birds nested earlier on sandy beaches and laid larger clutches and eggs than in salinas. These data suggest that, when both habitats are available, older and/or higher quality birds prefer sandy beaches for breeding, presumably trying to re-nest in salinas when first breeding attempts failed. We discuss conservation priorities and management actions for both habitats.},
annote = {Are salinas a suitable alternative breeding habitat for Little Terns Sterna albifrons? (Catry, Ramos, Catry, Allen-Revez, {\&} Grade, 2004)

Little terns switched their breeding sites from sandy beaches to salinas. However, salinas are gonna get lost in the next decades and are not ideal for their reproduction [7] 

Tucker {\&} Heath assesed that little terns' (Sternula albifrons) populations saw a decline in 19th and 20th century (as cited in Catry, Ramos, Catry, Allen-Revez, {\&} Grade, 2004) because of habitat change and human disturbance on their nesting sites (such as off-road vehicles and construction) (Lloyd et al ., 1991). Some authors hypothesize that salinas might be a suitable alternative for little terns to breed; however, little terns in salinas breed later and lay smaller and fewer eggs (Catry, Ramos, Catry, Allen-Revez, {\&} Grade, 2004). This is probably due to their age structure (Catry, Ramos, Catry, Allen-Revez, {\&} Grade, 2004). They have a population composed mainly by young individuals (Catry, Ramos, Catry, Allen-Revez, {\&} Grade, 2004). Young individuals tend to produce this sort of reproductive output (Catry, Ramos, Catry, Allen-Revez, {\&} Grade, 2004). This is normally associated with a less reproductive output, but studies are needed to support the hypothesis that salinas are bad environment for little terns to breed in. It might be that the nesting success in natural habitats now has diminished because of predators introduced by humans such as rats and dogs (Catry, Ramos, Catry, Allen-Revez, {\&} Grade, 2004). Little terns normally try to breed on sandy beaches, then if they do not succeed (which can be due to human disturbance) they re-nest in salinas (Catry, Ramos, Catry, Allen-Revez, {\&} Grade, 2004). However, the second nesting is likely to be less successful because of smaller clutches (Catry, Ramos, Catry, Allen-Revez, {\&} Grade, 2004). 50{\%} of the little terns that don't succeed at first, try it a second time in the salinas (Massey {\&} Fancher, 1989). 
Should we consider the salinas as a valid alternative to sandy beaches? Will this be the solution to little terns' habitat loss? Maybe not. In the past 30 years a lot of salinas in Portugal have been turned into rice fields and fish farms (I can't find the papers of these guys Pullan, 1988; Neves {\&} Rufino, 1994), causing the breeding birds to leave their colonies (Kotliar {\&} Burger, 1984). So there is still the problem of habitat loss for little terns (Catry, Ramos, Catry, Allen-Revez, {\&} Grade, 2004).},

abstract = {Different species occupy similar trophic positions in natural communities. However, ecologists have often overlooked the consequences of this variation for local communities by assuming that species occupying similar trophic positions are functionally similar. There have been few experimental tests of this important assumption. We tested the assumption of functional similarity by comparing the effect of six different predators (three fish and three salamander species) on an ensemble of larval anuran prey. Our experiment identified substantial variation in the impact of different predators on a variety of responses. Differences among predators in their selection of prey caused the structure of the larval anuran ensemble to vary continuously as opposed to producing discrete alternative states. Predators also differed in their ability to suppress either the total number or biomass of anurans. Thus, performance of larval anurans was dependent upon the identity of the predator. Moreover, the identity of predators judged similar and their degree of similarity depends on the specific response variable. In our study we found no predominance of weak or strong interactors, as predators appear to be evenly distributed along a gradient of interaction strengths. Knowledge of the identity of the species occupying a particular trophic position is crucial to predicting the impact of that trophic position on a community. Ecologists should not simply assume that species are functionally similar. The differing effects of different predators suggest that variation in their distribution across complex landscapes influences prey number, biomass, population dynamics, distribution, and ultimately local and regional species diversity.},

Biodiesel was extracted from Jatropha oil, 20{\%} (B20) concentration is found to be best blend ratio from the earlier experimental study. The engine was maintained at various compression ratio i.e., 17.5, 16.5 and 15.5 respectively. The main objective is to obtain minimum specific fuel consumption, better efficiency and lesser Emission with different compression ratio. The results concluded that full load show an increase in efficiency when compared with diesel, highest efficiency is obtained with B20MEOJBA with compression ratio 17.5. It is noted that there is an increase in thermal efficiency as the blend ratio increases. Biodiesel blend has performance closer to diesel, but emission is reduced in all blends of B20MEOJBA compared to diesel.

abstract = {Land-Use Change and Terrestrial Predator–Prey Networks Land-use change, here defined as the conversion of one land-use type into another (e.g., forest to arable land), affects biodiversity and biotic interactions worldwide (Sala et al., 2000). Although there has been large regional variation in the extent of agricultural expansion and abandonment in Europe in the past 50 years (Rabbinge and van Diepen, 2000), there has been a general trend that forest has expanded at the expense of agricultural land (Kankaanp{\"{a}}a and Carter, 2004; Rounsevell et al., 2006). The patterns have been similar in North America the past decades (Smith et al., 2010). Globally, particularly in developing countries, the general pattern has instead been agricultural expansion (Smith et al., 2010), threatening forest ecosystems (DeFries et al., 2010; Lambin and Meyfroidt, 2011; but see Angelsen, 2010). In fact, models predict an increase of cropland between 10 and 25{\%} up to 2050, mainly due to agricultural expansion in developing countries (Schmitz et al., 2014). Natural and semi-natural non-forest ecosystems are primarily threatened by a conversion to pasture land (Schmitz et al., 2014) or by cultivation with biofuels (Havl{\'{i}}k et al., 2011). Climate change is an important additional driver of land-use conversion, as the range of crop species contract or expand (Olesen and Bindi, 2002) and as forests adapt to changing climatic conditions (Spittlehouse and Stewart, 2004). In the past, effects of land-use change were often exclusively assessed by their impact on species richness (Tilman et al., 2001). Today, it has increasingly become evident that we need metrics that capture additional features of biological communities to understand consequences of land-use change on ecosystem functions and the provision of ecosystem services (Tylianakis et al., 2007; Diehl et al., 2013). Trophic interactions that link species in food webs are important components that modulate functions provided by biological communities (Lalibert{\'{e}} and Tylianakis, 2010; Tylianakis et al., 2010; Thompson et al., 2012). For example, the loss of large apex predators from an ecosystem due to anthropogenic disturbance may cascade through the food chain and lead to drastic effects on primary producers (Estes et al., 2011). Predator populations are often severely affected by anthropogenic disturbances (Attwood et al., 2008). Consequently, the conversion from one major land-use type into another may alter predator–prey interactions (Ives et al., 2005) and the provision of predator-mediated ecosystem services such as the control of agricultural pests (conservation biological control; Barbosa, 1998).},

abstract = {Humans have drastically changed much of the world's acoustic background with anthropogenic sounds that are markedly different in pitch and amplitude than sounds in most natural habitats [1-4]. This novel acoustic background may be detrimental for many species, particularly birds [1]. We evaluated conservation concerns that noise limits bird distributions and reduces nesting success via a natural experiment to isolate the effects of noise from confounding stimuli and to control for the effect of noise on observer detection biases [5]. We show that noise alone reduces nesting species richness and leads to different avian communities. Contrary to expectations, noise indirectly facilitates reproductive success of individuals nesting in noisy areas as a result of the disruption of predator-prey interactions. The higher reproductive success for birds within noisy habitats may be a previously unrecognized factor contributing to the success of urban-adapted species and the loss of birds less tolerant of noise. Additionally, our findings suggest that noise can have cascading consequences for communities through altered species interactions. Given that noise pollution is becoming ubiquitous throughout much of the world, knowledge of species-specific responses to noise and the cumulative effects of these novel acoustics may be crucial to understanding and managing human-altered landscapes. {\textcopyright}2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The interactions between plants and their animal pollinators and seed dispersers have moulded much of Earth's biodiversity. Recently, it has been shown that these mutually beneficial interactions form complex networks with a well-defined architecture that may contribute to biodiversity persistence. Little is known, however, about which ecological and evolutionary processes generate these network patterns. Here we use phylogenetic methods to show that the phylogenetic relationships of species predict the number of interactions they exhibit in more than one-third of the networks, and the identity of the species with which they interact in about half of the networks. As a consequence of the phylogenetic effects on interaction patterns, simulated extinction events tend to trigger coextinction cascades of related species. This results in a non-random pruning of the evolutionary tree and a more pronounced loss of taxonomic diversity than expected in the absence of a phylogenetic signal. Our results emphasize how the simultaneous consideration of phylogenetic information and network architecture can contribute to our understanding of the structure and fate of species-rich communities. {\textcopyright}2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {Understanding how ecological communities are structured and how this may vary between different types of ecosystems is a fundamental question in ecology. We develop a general framework for quantifying size-structure within and among different ecosystem types (e.g. terrestrial, freshwater or marine), via the use of a suite of bivariate relationships between organismal size and properties of individuals, populations, assemblages, pair-wise interactions, and network topology. Each of these relationships can be considered a dimension of size-structure, along which real communities lie on a continuous scale. For example, the strength, slope, or elevation of the body mass-versus-abundance or predator size-versus-prey size relationships may vary systematically among ecosystem types. We draw on examples from the literature and suggest new ways to use allometries for comparing among ecosystem types, which we illustrate by applying them to published data. Finally, we discuss how dimensions of size-structure are interconnected and how we could approach this complex hierarchy systematically. We conclude: (1) there are multiple dimensions of size-structure; (2) communities may be size-structured in some of these dimensions, but not necessarily in others; (3) across-system comparisons via rigorous quantitative statistical methods are possible, and (4) insufficient data are currently available to illuminate thoroughly the full extent and nature of differences in size-structure among ecosystem types. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.},

In Hylobates lar, increased calling frequencies of groups may be indicative of intruder pressure, as may reduced calling frequencies of animals which are avoiding confrontation with conspecifics or avoiding detection by loggers. In Presbytis melalophos the function of calling is to mediate intergroup avoidance, such that differential calling frequencies would not be expected. Where reduction in calling occurs it is probably directed toward concealment from loggers.

abstract = {The application of general successional theory to stream ecosystems has not been widely addressed due to a lack of long-term studies on stream channels at sufficiently large spatial scales. Wolf Point Creek in Glacier Bay, Alaska, a lake-fed stream that began to emerge from under glacial ice in the mid-1940s, offers an opportunity to address this imbalance. We examine the stream's development from 1977 to 2005, with reference to concepts of succession and community assembly. Dispersal constraints have influenced the succession, as non-insect taxa required at least 20 years to colonize. We suggest that tolerance is a major mechanism of macroinvertebrate community assembly. Most taxa, with the exception of the cold-tolerant first colonizers, have persisted within the community following colonization, although relative abundance has changed markedly with time. However, biotic processes do influence colonization and succession. Redd (nest) digging by spawning salmon creates disturbed patches that facilitate the persistence of some early colonizers, and riparian vegetation facilitates colonization by caddisflies and chironomids. We further suggest that both deterministic and stochastic elements influence succession and community assembly in streams. Our study highlights the importance of reestablishing riparian vegetation during stream restoration programs and of increased in-stream habitat complexity from inputs of coarse woody debris to improve nutrient retention, particularly of salmon carcasses. {\textcopyright} The Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Food web statistics showed a complex relationship with measures of habitat variability in temporary ponds. Connectance was highest in short-duration, highly variable habitats, and lowest in habitats of intermediate duration and variability. The number of links and links/taxon increased with increasing duration. Much of the variation in the food web statistics could be explained by a strong linear relationship between number of taxa and number of links/taxon and a quadratic relationship of taxa number with the number of links. However, after accounting for this variation, there remained a relationship of duration with links and links/taxon. The relationship between the food web statistics and duration corresponded to experimental evaluations of predation in these habitats that showed an increasing importance of predation in long-duration habitats. The fund web statistics, however, missed threshold effects in the relationship between predation and habitat duration. Differences in food web statistics before and after a regional drought could be explained by a decrease in taxa number after the drought. Connectance was the most robust statistic in relation to taxa number, but was also the least sensitive to changes in habitat characteristics.},

abstract = {(Z)-4-undecenal (Z4-11Al) is the volatile pheromone produced by females of the vinegar fly Drosophila melanogaster. Female flies emit Z4-11Al at few nanograms per hour, for species-specific communication and mate-finding. Tests with synthetic Z4-11Al show that it has a characteristic off-flavour, which we perceive even at the small amounts produced by one female fly. Since only females produce Z4-11Al, and not males, we can reliably distinguish between single D. melanogaster males and females, according to their scent. A wine-tasting panel finds that we sense as little as 1 ng synthetic Z4-11Al in a glass of wine, and 10 ng Z4-11Al is perceived as a loud off-flavour. This corroborates the observation that a glass of wine is spoilt by a single D. melanogaster fly falling into it, which we here show is caused by Z4-11Al. The biological role of Z4-11Al or structurally related aldehydes in humans and the basis for this semiochemical convergence remains yet unclear.},

To date, we have had restricted understanding of the benefits and risks that species redistribution may pose to individual countries, and a limited appreciation of the variability in current opportunities for developing effective monitoring approaches that build on existing national frameworks. To assess the present level of ecological, economic and societal risks and opportunities associated with new arrivals of species driven by changes in climatic conditions, we conducted a review of the available information on changes in animal species (both terrestrial and marine) distribution suspected to be linked to climate change in the United Kingdom over the past 10 years (2008–2018). We found evidence that at least 55 species have arrived in new locations in the country due to climate change in the past decade, with 22 of them suspected to impact positively or negatively the recipient ecosystems, or nearby human communities. Ten of these 55 species were identified using keywords and hashtags on social media. Synthesis and applications. Our work identifies pressing monitoring gaps relevant to the management of species on the move and discusses the potential for social media to help address current information needs. It also calls for more theoretical work to enable the quick identification of species likely to be problematic (or beneficial) and locations likely to experience significant ecological and societal impacts from biodiversity's redistribution under a changing climate.},

However, we lack a predictive framework for the sensitivity of megabiota during times of rapid global change and how they impact the functioning of ecosystems and the biosphere. Here, we extend metabolic scaling theory and use global simulation models to demonstrate that (i) megabiota are more prone to extinction due to human land use, hunting, and climate change; (ii) loss of megabiota has a negative impact on ecosystem metabolism and functioning; and (iii) their reduction has and will continue to significantly decrease biosphere functioning. Global simulations show that continued loss of large animals alone could lead to a 44{\%}, 18{\%} and 92{\%} reduction in terrestrial heterotrophic biomass, metabolism, and fertility respectively. Our findings suggest that policies that emphasize the promotion of large trees and animals will have disproportionate impact on biodiversity, ecosystem processes, and climate mitigation.},

abstract = {Road traffic noise propagation through a vegetation belt of limited depth (15 m) containing periodically arranged trees along a road is numerically assessed by means of 3D finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) calculations. The computational cost is reduced by only modeling a representative strip of the planting scheme and assuming periodic extension by applying mirror planes. With increasing tree stem diameter and decreasing spacing, traffic noise insertion loss is predicted to be more pronounced for each planting scheme considered (simple cubic, rectangular, triangular and face-centered cubic). For rectangular schemes, the spacing parallel to the road axis is predicted to be the determining parameter for the acoustic performance. Significant noise reduction is predicted to occur for a tree spacing of less than 3 m and a tree stem diameter of more than 0.11 m. This positive effect comes on top of the increase in ground effect (near 3 dBA for a light vehicle at 70 km/h) when compared to sound propagation over grassland. The noise reducing effect of the forest floor and the optimized tree belt arrangement are found to be of similar importance in the calculations performed. The effect of shrubs with typical above-ground biomass is estimated to be at maximum 2 dBA in the uniform scattering approach applied for a light vehicle at 70 km/h. Downward scattering from tree crowns is predicted to be smaller than 1 dBA for a light vehicle at 70 km/h, for various distributions of scattering elements representing the tree crown. The effect of the presence of tree stems, shrubs and tree crowns is predicted to be approximately additive. Inducing some (pseudo) randomness in stem center location, tree diameter, and omitting a limited number of rows with trees seem to hardly affect the insertion loss. These predictions suggest that practically achievable vegetation belts can compete to the noise reducing performance of a classical thin noise barrier (on grassland) with a height of 1-1.5 m (in a non-refracting atmosphere). {\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The mutually beneficial interactions between plants and their animal pollinators and seed dispersers have been paramount in the generation of Earth's biodiversity. These mutualistic interactions often involve dozens or even hundreds of species that form complex networks of interdependences. Understanding how coevolution proceed in these highly diversified mutualisms among free-living species presents a conceptual challenge. Recent work has led to the unambiguous conclusion that mutualistic networks are very heterogeneous (the bulk of the species have a few interactions, but a few species are much more connected than expected by chance), nested (specialists interact with subsets of the species with which generalists interact), and built on weak and asymmetric links among species. Both ecological variables (e.g., pheology, local abundance, and geographic range) and past evolutionary history may explain such network patterns. Network structure ahs important implications for the coexistence and stability of species as well as for the coevolutionary process. Mutualistic networks can thus be regarded as the architecture of biodiversity.},

abstract = {Predicted trends towards more intense droughts are of particular significance for running water ecosystems, as the loss of critical stream habitat can provoke sudden changes in biodiversity and shifts in community structure. However, analysing ecological responses to the progressive loss of stream habitat requires a continuous disturbance gradient that can only be generated through large-scale manipulations of streamflow. In the first experiment of its kind, we used large artificial stream channels (mesocosms) as analogues of spring-fed headwaters and simulated a gradient of drought intensity that encompassed flowing streams, disconnected pools, and dry streambeds. We used breakpoint analysis to analyse macroinvertebrate community responses to intensifying drought, and identify the taxa and compositional metrics sensitive to small changes in drought stress. We detected breakpoints for {\textgreater}60{\%} of taxa, signalling sudden population crashes or irruptions as drought intensified. Abrupt changes were most pronounced where riffle dewatering isolated pools. In the remnant wetted habitat, we observed a shift to larger body sizes across the community, primarily driven by irruptions of predatory midge larvae and coincident population collapses among prey species (worms and smaller midges). Our results suggest that intense predation in confined, fragmented stream habitat can lead to unexpected changes in body sizes, challenging the conventional wisdom that droughts favour the small. Pool fragmentation might thus be the most critical stage of habitat loss during future droughts, as the point at which impacted rivers and streams begin to exhibit major shifts in fundamental food web properties.},

abstract = {Various definitions and indices have been proposed in the literature to identify keystone species. In this study, we intended to make the concept of keystone species operational for marine biodiversity conservation. We used an exclusive definition of keystone species, based on the original concept of keystone predator, and derived a new functional index of keystoneness (KS) from an ecosystem-modeling approach. First, several KS indices were formulated, by combining measures of the mixed-trophic impact (MTI) and biomass of species. Then, a meta-analysis was performed, based on 101 published Ecopath food-web models, selected with a scoring method, and representative of the variety of marine ecosystems worldwide. The indices were applied to the models, and two statistical methods were compared to select the most promising KS index. Rank correlation tests were performed to assess the balance between the contribution of the impact and biomass components to the different KS indices. In addition, a classification tree was implemented, based on ecosystemspecific thresholds applied to the latter species traits, and used to confirm the identified keystone species. The selected index obtained the highest number of models with positive results from both the rank correlation tests and the classification tree. We also demonstrated the limitations of existing KS indices previously applied in the literature. Species were ranked according to their estimates of keystoneness with the selected KS index, so that potential keystone species were quantitatively identified in the 101 modeled food webs. The standardized modeling approach allowed for a comparison of the identified keystone species across models: cartilaginous fishes and toothed whales obtained the highest occurrences. Finally, the selected KS index was applied to the well-known case study of Prince William Sound (Alaska, USA). Potentially significant anthropogenic (fishing) impacts on keystone species were also considered and discussed. The operational methodology presented is directly applicable to marine food webs, and may be adapted to other (freshwater or terrestrial) systems.},

abstract = {Lateral gene transfer (LGT) is a major evolutionary mechanism in prokaryotes. Knowledge about LGT— particularly, multicellular— eukaryotes has only recently started to accumulate. A widespread assumption sees the gene as the unit of LGT, largely because little is yet known about how LGT chances are affected by structural/functional features at the subgenic level. Here we trace the evolutionary trajectory of VEin Patterning 1, a novel gene family known to be essential for plant development and defense. At the subgenic level VEP1 encodes a dinucleotide-binding Rossmann-fold domain, in common with members of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) protein family. We found: i) VEP1 likely originated in an aerobic, mesophilic and chemoorganotrophic $\alpha$-proteobacterium, and was laterally propagated through nets of ecological interactions, including multiple LGTs between phylogenetically distant green plant/fungi-associated bacteria, and five independent LGTs to eukaryotes. Of these latest five transfers, three are ancient LGTs, implicating an ancestral fungus, the last common ancestor of land plants and an ancestral trebouxiophyte green alga, and two are recent LGTs to modern embryophytes. ii) VEP1's rampant LGT behavior was enabled by the robustness and broad utility of the dinucleotide-binding Rossmann-fold, which provided a platform for the evolution of two unprecedented departures from the canonical SDR catalytic triad. iii) The fate of VEP1 in eukaryotes has been different in different lineages, being ubiquitous and highly conserved in land plants, whereas fungi underwent multiple losses. And iv) VEP1-harboring bacteria include non-phytopathogenic and phytopathogenic symbionts which are non-randomly distributed with respect to the type of harbored VEP1 gene. Our findings suggest that VEP1 may have been instrumental for the evolutionary transition of green plants to land, and point to a LGT-mediated ‘Trojan Horse' mechanism for the evolution of bacterial pathogenesis against plants. VEP1 may serve as tool for revealing microbial interactions in plant/fungi-associated environments.},

abstract = {Predation and competition are recognised as strong community structuring forces, and these processes are often mediated by keystone species. However, the role of keystone species in the plankton of temporary wetlands has hardly been evaluated. In the present study, the potential structuring role of fairy shrimps (Anostraca, Branchiopoda) on temporary wetland zooplankton communities was assessed. Dry sediments were collected from randomly chosen temporary ponds in the Campo de Calatrava area (Central Spain), and these were rewetted in outdoor microcosms. Zooplankton community dynamics of three wetlands that lacked fairy shrimps (controls) were contrasted with three wetlands that contained Branchinecta orientalis (G. O. Sars) (treatment). ANOVA analyses showed no significant differences in zooplankton community metrics and in taxonomic groups between the controls and treatments. Analyses of similarity (ANOSIM) and similarity percentages (SIMPER) revealed significant differences and a high degree of community dissimilarity within and between treatment levels. The high degree of environmental variability between wetlands compromised the detection of the structuring role of fairy shrimps on zooplankton in the present study. Studies based on manipulative designs could be more appropriate to test for the keystone role of fairy shrimps in temporary wetland food webs. Replicated before-after control-impact (BACI) designs could be especially useful for understanding basic ecological processes and this knowledge could then be used for the development of sound management strategies of ecologically poorly understood temporary ponds. {\textcopyright} CSIRO 2007.},

In this study we examined individual and social factors that may influence the frequency with which individuals engage in drumming behavior when producing long distance pant hoot vocalizations, and analyzed the temporal structure of those drumming bouts. Male chimpanzees from Budongo Forest, Uganda, drummed significantly more frequently during travel than feeding or resting and older individuals were significantly more likely to produce drumming bouts than younger ones. In contrast, we found no evidence that the presence of estrus females, high ranking males and preferred social partners in the caller's vicinty had an effect on the frequency with which an individual accompanied their pant hoot vocalization with drumming. Through acoustic analyses, we demonstrated that drumming sequences produced with pant hoots may have contained information on individual identity and that qualitatively, there was individual variation in the complexity of the temporal patterns produced. We conclude that drumming patterns may act as individually distinctive long-distance signals that, together with pant hoot vocalizations, function to coordinate the movement and spacing of dispersed individuals within a community, rather than as signals to group members in the immediate audience.

Nowadays it is already an established fact that our economic and social life is based on the limited natural resources and enjoys different benefits of the ecosystems (“ecosystem services”). By reason of this, ecosystems do not only mean one sector among the others but due to the ecosystem services they are in relationship with most of the sectors and global changes influence our life mainly through their changes. In the last decades direct and indirect effects of the climate change on terrestrial and marine ecosystems can already be observed, on the level of individuals, populations, species, ecosystem composition and function as well. Based on the analysis of data series covering at least twenty years, statistically significant relationship can be revealed between temperature and the change in biological-physical parameters of the given tax on in case of more than 500 taxes. Researchers have shown changes in the phonological, morphological, physiological and behaviour characteristics of the taxes, in the frequency of epidemics and damages, in the ranges of species and other indirect effects. In our present study we would like to examine closely the effects of climate change on community ecology, throwing light on some methodological questions and possibilities of studying the topic. To understand the effects of climate change it is not enough to collect ecological field observations and experimental approaches yield results only with limited validity as well. Therefore great importance is attached to the presentation of modelling methods and some possibilities of application are described by means of concrete case studies. This chapter describes the so-called strategic model of a theoretical community in detail, with the help of which relevant results can be yielded in relation to ecological issues such as “Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis” (IDH). Adapting the model to real field data, the so-called tactical model of the phytoplankton community of a great atrophic river (Danube, Hungary) was developed. Thus we show in a hydro biological case study which influence warming can have on the maximum amount of phytoplankton in the examined aquatic habitat. The case studies of the strategic and tactical models are contrasted with other approaches, such as the method of „geographical analogy”. The usefulness of the method is demonstrated with the example of Hungarian agro-ecosystems.},

abstract = {There is an urgent need to understand the effect of climate warming on the carbon dynamics of lakes and ponds in order to assess contributions to global carbon budgets. Currently, we are unable to predict how the exchange of carbon gases (i.e. CO2) across the air-water boundary and organic carbon storage in the sediments will be altered with realistic warming scenarios downscaled from climatic models. Given the prevalence of shallow systems and tight atmospheric coupling, we conducted a mesocosm experiment to test the impacts of warming on CO2 saturation in a shallow prairie pond. We outline and test three possible scenarios for the effect of warming on the CO2 saturation of ponds, resulting in either an increase, decrease or no net effect for CO2 saturation. We show that with approximately a two-degree (oC) increase in average water temperature, the pCO2 of the warmed mesocosms was nine times greater than the ambient temperature mesocosms by the end of the 5-week experiment. Changes in water colour (a measure of dissolved organic carbon) in warmed systems indicate that decomposition of organic matter in the sediments and water column was the main contributor to the increase in pCO2 in the warmed mesocosms. Our results show that with warming, the release of CO2 from shallow ponds to the atmosphere will increase and carbon storage in the sediments will decrease, altering the current functioning of shallow prairie ponds and influencing the contribution of ponds to the global carbon cycle. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author(s).},

We explore what this concept of equivalence means in ecological communities, how such species may arise evolutionarily, and how the possibility of ecological equivalents relates to previous ideas about niche differentiation. We also show that the co-occurrence of ecologically similar or equivalent species is not incompatible with niche theory as has been supposed, because niche relations can sometimes favor coexistence of similar species. We argue that both evolutionary and ecological processes operate to promote the introduction and to sustain the persistence of ecologically similar and in many cases nearly equivalent species embedded in highly structured food webs. Future work should focus on synthesizing niche and neutral perspectives rather than dichotomously debating whether neutral or niche models provide better explanations for community structure and biodiversity. {\textcopyright} 2006 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Just as important, but much more difficult to discern, is the anthropogenic elimination of ecological interactions. Here we report on the persistence of a long ecological interaction chain linking diverse food webs and habitats in the near-pristine portions of a remote Pacific atoll. Using biogeochemical assays, animal tracking, and field surveys we show that seabirds roosting on native trees fertilize soils, increasing coastal nutrients and the abundance of plankton, thus attracting manta rays to native forest coastlines. Partnered observations conducted in regions of this atoll where native trees have been replaced by human propagated palms reveal that this complex interaction chain linking trees to mantas readily breaks down. Taken together these findings provide a compelling example of how anthropogenic disturbance may be contributing to widespread reductions in ecological interaction chain length, thereby isolating and simplifying ecosystems.},

In this review, we first examine the different possible effects of climate change that can operate at individual, population, species, community, ecosystem and biome scales, notably showing that species can respond to climate change challenges by shifting their climatic niche along three non-exclusive axes: time (e.g. phenology), space (e.g. range) and self (e.g. physiology). Then, we present the principal specificities and caveats of the most common approaches used to estimate future biodiversity at global and sub-continental scales and we synthesise their results. Finally, we highlight several challenges for future research both in theoretical and applied realms. Overall, our review shows that current estimates are very variable, depending on the method, taxonomic group, biodiversity loss metrics, spatial scales and time periods considered. Yet, the majority of models indicate alarming consequences for biodiversity, with the worst-case scenarios leading to extinction rates that would qualify as the sixth mass extinction in the history of the earth. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {Extreme climatic events are expected to increase in frequency and intensity under climate change. Climate models predict shifts in rainfall patterns that will exacerbate drought, with potentially devastating effects on freshwater ecosystems. Experimental approaches are now advocated to explore the impact of extreme events on natural systems: here, we synthesise research conducted in a stream mesocosms experiment to simulate the effect of prolonged drought on the structure and functioning of complex food webs in a 2-year manipulation of flow regimes. Drought triggered the losses of species and trophic interactions, especially among rare predators, leading to the partial collapse of the food webs. Drying caused marked taxonomic and functional turnover in algal primary producers, from encrusting greens to diatoms, whereas the total number of algal taxa in the food webs remained unchanged. The recurrent drying disturbances generated transient macroinvertebrate communities dominated by relatively few, r-selected, species and compensatory dynamics sustained total macroinvertebrate densities. However, the standing biomass and secondary production of the food webs were more than halved by the droughts. Consumer-resource biomass flux was also strongly suppressed by disturbance, yet several network-level properties (such as connectance and interaction diversity) were conserved, driven by consumer-resource fidelity and a reconfiguration of fluxes within the webs, as production shifted down the size spectrum towards the smaller species. Our research demonstrates that flow extremes could have far-reaching consequences for the structure and functioning of complex freshwater communities. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Peat-swamp forest has recently been recognized as an important habitat for the Southern Bornean gibbon (Hylobates albibarbis), but information is scarce on the factors that link gibbon density to characteristics of this unique ecosystem. Our aims in this study were firstly to estimate gibbon density in different forest subtypes in a newly protected, secondary peat-swamp forest in the Sabangau Catchment, Indonesia, and secondly to identify which vegetation characteristics correlate with gibbon density. Data collection was conducted in a 37.1 km(2) area, using auditory sampling methods and vegetation "speed plotting". Gibbon densities varied between survey sites from 1.39 to 3.92 groups/km(2). Canopy cover, tree height, density of large trees and food availability were significantly correlated with gibbon density, identifying the preservation of tall trees and good canopy cover as a conservation priority for the gibbon population in the Sabangau forest. This survey indicates that selective logging, which specifically targets large trees and disrupts canopy cover, is likely to have adverse effects on gibbon populations in peat-swamp forests, and calls for greater protection of these little-studied ecosystems.},

abstract = {With the application of the topological network concept to study food webs, species uniqueness in terms of irreplaceability has begun to be considered when identifying important species in the ecosystem. Based on the uniqueness method of quantifying the interactions and trophic field overlap of species in food webs, we propose using the weighted trophic field overlap (WTO) to determine the uniqueness of species in a topological network by considering the proportions of prey in the diets of predators. This proposed method involves measuring the uniqueness of species structurally and mathematically to overcome the deficiencies of the traditional method (the sum of trophic field overlap, STO), which only relies on the topological structure of the food web. We compared the species ranking results obtained via the WTO and STO methods using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and compared the Spearman rank correlation coefficients between them and three other topological indices. In this study, we focused on the food web of Haizhou Bay ecosystem. The results showed that Leptochela gracilis, Acetes sp., Alpheus japonicus, Engraulis japonicus, and Alpheus distinguendus were the most unique species in the food web of Haizhou Bay. They had the lowest WTO values, and three of these species were not identified as unique by the traditional method. However, they play important roles as prey in Haizhou Bay ecosystem and have high interaction strengths with other species in the food web weighted by the proportion of prey, which are not recognized by the traditional method. The proposed index is sensitive to changes in the diets of predators since slight fluctuations may cause the index to vary considerably. The proposed methodology could be extended to other marine ecosystems to identify unique species from a practical and dynamic perspective and will contribute to the protection of unique species that maintain the trophic diversity of food webs and ecosystem robustness.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Knowledge of mammal migrations is low, and human impacts on migrations high. This jeopardizes efforts to conserve terrestrial migrations. To aid the conservation of these migrations, we synthesized information worldwide, describing 24 large-bodied ungulates that migrate in aggregations. This synthesis includes maps of extinct and extant migrations, numbers of migrants, summaries of ecological drivers and threats migrants confront. As data are often lacking, we outlined steps for science to address and inform conservation actions. We evaluated migrants against this framework, and reported their status. Mass migrations for 6 species are extinct or unknown. Most remaining migrants (n = 9) occur from 6 locations in Africa, with Eurasia and North America containing 6 and 4 remaining mass migrants, respectively (with caribou/ reindeer Rangifer tarandus occurring in both regions). All migrants declined in abundance, except wildebeest and other migrants in the Serengeti-Mara Ecosystem (SME), white-eared kob and tiang in Sudan, and some caribou populations. Protected areas only contain migrations for 5 species in the SME, chiru on the Tibetan Plateau, and some caribou populations in North America. Most mass migrants track the seasonal and shifting patterns of greening vegetation over expanses of savannahs, steppes, and grasslands. Principal threats include overhunting and habitat loss from livestock, agriculture and fencing that excludes animals from forage or water. Conservation science overlooks numerous migrations, so many have already disappeared and continue to do so. Key principles for conserving migrants, exemplified by the SME and Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE), include securing seasonal ranges, resource protection, government support and minimizing fences. This review forms a baseline for initiating conservation action for many ungulate migrations needing attention. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2009.},

abstract = {Links in food webs can be classified as functional, which affect robustness, and redundant, which do not affect robustness. We explore whether this topologically based distinction may still be informative when interaction strength is considered. In 81 weighted food webs we identified functional and redundant links by exploiting the method of generalized dominators, and tested whether the two groups could be patterned according to link strength.Overall, redundant connections are weaker than functional links. However this pattern does not hold for every food web. Also, the difference in strength between functional and redundant links seems to depend on food web topology. In fact the systems in which redundant connections are significantly weaker than functional ones show greater connectance than systems in which the difference in strength between the two groups is not significant.We observed that redundant connections are fundamental in the formation of omnivory modules that have been described as being crucial for the stability/persistence of food webs. Although stability can be promoted by the specific arrangement of links magnitude within these modules, it does not necessarily imply that redundant links have to be weaker than functional connections at the whole web scale.},

abstract = {Human-induced habitat destruction, overexploitation, introduction of alien species and climate change are causing species to go extinct at unprecedented rates, from local to global scales. There are growing concerns that these kinds of disturbances alter important functions of ecosystems. Our current understanding is that key parameters of a community (e.g. its functional diversity, species composition, and presence/absence of vulnerable species) reflect an ecological network's ability to resist or rebound from change in response to pressures and disturbances, such as species loss. If the food web structure is relatively simple, we can analyse the roles of different species interactions in determining how environmental impacts translate into species loss. However, when ecosystems harbour species-rich communities, as is the case in most natural systems, then the complex network of ecological interactions makes it a far more challenging task to perceive how species' functional roles influence the consequences of species loss. One approach to deal with such complexity is to focus on the functional traits of species in order to identify their respective roles: for instance, large species seem to be more susceptible to extinction than smaller species. Here, we introduce and analyse the marine food web from the high Antarctic Weddell Sea Shelf to illustrate the role of species traits in relation to network robustness of this complex food web. Our approach was threefold: firstly, we applied a new classification system to all species, grouping them by traits other than body size; secondly, we tested the relationship between body size and food web parameters within and across these groups and finally, we calculated food web robustness. We addressed questions regarding (i) patterns of species functional/trophic roles, (ii) relationships between species functional roles and body size and (iii) the role of species body size in terms of network robustness. Our results show that when analyzing relationships between trophic structure, body size and network structure, the diversity of predatory species types needs to be considered in future studies. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Premise of the study: Seabirds often cause signifi cant changes to soil properties, and seabird-dominated systems often host unique plant communities. This study experimentally (1) examined species-specifi c responses to seabird guano gradients, (2) considered the role that differential functional traits among species play in altering plant response to guano, and (3) investigated the implications of seabird guano on range-expanding species. Methods: Using a greenhouse fertilization experiment, we examined how guano fertilization affects the growth and functional traits of four tree species dominant in the Pacific Islands: Cocos nucifera, Pisonia grandis, Scaevola sericea, and Tournefortia argentea. In these systems, seabirds are frequently found in association with three of these four species; the remaining species, C. nucifera, is a recently proliferating species commonly found in the region but rarely associated with seabirds. Key results: We determined that responses to guano addition differed significantly between species in ways that were consistent with predictions based on differing functional traits among species. Notably, we demonstrated that C. nucifera showed no growth responses to guano additions, whereas all seabird-associated plants showed strong responses. Conclusions: These results provide experimental evidence of differential species response to guano additions, suggesting that differences in species functional traits may contribute to changes in plant communities in seabird-dominated areas, with seabird- associated species garnering performance advantages in these high-nutrient environments. Among these species, results also suggest that C. nucifera may have a competitive advantage in low-nutrient environments, providing an unusual example of how a range-expanding plant species can profi t from low-nutrient environments. {\textcopyright} 2011 Botanical Society of America.},

abstract = {The composition of a peatland plant community has considerable effect on a range of ecosystem functions. Peatland plant community structure is predicted to change under future climate change, making the quantification of the direction and magnitude of this change a research priority. We subjected intact, replicated vegetated poor fen peat monoliths to elevated temperatures, increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), and two water table levels in a factorial design to determine the individual and synergistic effects of climate change factors on the poor fen plant community composition. We identify three indicators of a regime shift occurring in our experimental poor fen system under climate change: nonlinear decline of Sphagnum at temperatures 8 °C above ambient conditions, concomitant increases in Carex spp. at temperatures 4 °C above ambient conditions suggesting a weakening of Sphagnum feedbacks on peat accumulation, and increased variance of the plant community composition and pore water pH through time. A temperature increase of +4 °C appeared to be a threshold for increased vascular plant abundance; however the magnitude of change was species dependent. Elevated temperature combined with elevated CO2 had a synergistic effect on large graminoid species abundance, with a 15 times increase as compared to control conditions. Community analyses suggested that the balance between dominant plant species was tipped from Sphagnum to a graminoid-dominated system by the combination of climate change factors. Our findings indicate that changes in peatland plant community composition are likely under future climate change conditions, with a demonstrated shift toward a dominance of graminoid species in poor fens.},

abstract = {Functional diversity is a component of biodiversity that generally concerns the range of things that organisms do in communities and ecosystems. Here, we review how functional diversity can explain and predict the impact of organisms on ecosystems and thereby provide a mechanistic link between the two. Critical points in developing predictive measures of functional diversity are the choice of functional traits with which organisms are distinguished, how the diversity of that trait information is summarized into a measure of functional diversity, and that the measures of functional diversity are validated through quantitative analyses and experimental tests. There is a vast amount of trait information available for plant species and a substantial amount for animals. Choosing which traits to include in a particular measure of functional diversity will depend on the specific aims of a particular study. Quantitative methods for choosing traits and for assigning weighting to traits are being developed, but need much more work before we can be confident about trait choice. The number of ways of measuring functional diversity is growing rapidly. We divide them into four main groups. The first, the number of functional groups or types, has significant problems and researchers are more frequently using measures that do not require species to be grouped. Of these, some measure diversity by summarizing distances between species in trait space, some by estimating the size of the dendrogram required to describe the difference, and some include information about species' abundances. We show some new and important differences between these, as well as what they indicate about the responses of assemblages to loss of individuals. There is good experimental and analytical evidence that functional diversity can provide a link between organisms and ecosystems but greater validation of measures is required. We suggest that non-significant results have a range of alternate explanations that do not necessarily contradict positive effects of functional diversity. Finally, we suggest areas for development of techniques used to measure functional diversity, highlight some exciting questions that are being addressed using ideas about functional diversity, and suggest some directions for novel research.},

abstract = {Identifying the ecological mechanisms that determine foodweb structure is critical for understanding the causes and consequences of diversity. Food-chain length (FCL) is a product of the biotic interactions within a community and the environment, but how environmental variation affects FCL is not well understood. We examined how gradients of ecosystem size and environmental variation in hydroperiod affected the FCL of ponds. Using C and N stable isotopes, we found that average FCL was 3.3 and varied by 3 trophic levels across ponds and years. We showed that ponds with shorter hydroperiods have shorter food chains, and that FCL is not strongly influenced by ecosystem size. These results demonstrate support for the dynamic constraints hypothesis, which states that less-predictable environments should have shorter food chains. Our data are not consistent with the prediction of the ecosystem size hypothesis that larger ecosystems have longer food chains. Insect and amphibian richness increased with increasing pond size and hydroperiod, results indicating that insertion of new species into the pond communities is a driving mechanism causing variation in FCL. Omnivory could explain variation in FCL, but our results show that the incidence of omnivory was similar across the environmental gradients. Ours is one of the few empirical studies to link structural changes in the food web with variability in FCL. We showed that temporal variation and species composition shape pond communities and influence foodweb structure. {\textcopyright} 2013 by The Society for Freshwater Science.},

Based on information from a total of 57 samples the present meta-analysis finds mean correlations between psycho-social variables and pro-environmental behaviour similar to those reported by Hines et al. In a second step, the matrix of pooled correlations is used for a structural equation modelling (SEM) test of theoretically postulated structural relations between eight determinants of pro-environmental behaviour (so-called Meta-analytic SEM (MASEM)). MASEM results confirm that pro-environmental behavioural intention mediate the impact of all other psycho-social variables on pro-environmental behaviour (27{\%} explained variance). Results also confirm that besides attitude and behavioural control personal moral norm is a third predictor of pro-environmental behavioural intention (52{\%} explained variance). The MASEM also indicates that problem awareness is an important but indirect determinant of pro-environmental intention. Its impact seems to be mediated by moral and social norms, guilt and attribution processes. {\textcopyright}2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {1. A food web is presented which describes trophic interactions among the herbivores, parasitoids, predators and pathogens associated with broom, Cytisus scoparius (L.) Link. The data come from published work on the community at a single site. The web comprises a total of 154 taxa: one plant, 19 herbivores, 66 parasitoids, 60 predators, five omnivores and three pathogens. There are 370 trophic links between these taxa in the web. The taxa form 82 functionally distinct groups, called trophic species. 2. Predators consumed significantly more species than did parasitoids: a median of two prey species per species of predator (range = 1-9), compared to a median of one host species per species of parasitoid (range = 1-4). Significant differences in the number of species consumed were also found among the five predator groups: birds (median = 4), spiders (median = 5), Coleoptera (median = 1), Diptera (median = 2) and Hemiptera (median = 7). 3. Vulnerability, measured by numbers of consumer species, was significantly affected by the herbivores' feeding styles: externally feeding herbivores were most vulnerable and the concealed herbivores were least vulnerable. Miners were vulnerable to the most parasitoid species and externally feeding herbivores were the most vulnerable to predators. 4. Resource species had a median vulnerability of 13 consumer species, a figure far higher than that in most published food webs. No significant relationship was found between species' vulnerability to predators and vulnerability to parasitoids. However, there was a strong negative relationship between the percentage mortality due to predation and percentage mortality due to parasitism. 5. The broom food web contains nine orders of insects, a figure higher than previously recorded. The web also contains vertebrates, arachnids, bacteria and fungi. Most of the interactions between the orders were weak. Connectance was calculated for the complete web, the parasitoid sub-web and the predator sub-web. The connectance of the predator sub-web, a value of 0.0364, was more than an order of magnitude larger than the connectance of the entire web (0.0156) or the parasitoid sub-web (0.018). 6. The body lengths of 52 species in the food web were estimated from field guides or museum specimens. Larger predators consumed smaller prey in 93{\%} of predator-prey interactions. Smaller parasitoids consumed larger hosts in 79{\%} of parasitoid-host interactions. Parasitoids were significantly smaller than predators. 7. The 52 species were arranged in order of increasing body length along the columns and down the rows of a food web matrix. The predator sub-web was predominantly upper triangular with 8{\%} of non-zero elements falling below the leading diagonal. The parasitoid sub-web was predominantly lower triangular with 21{\%} non-zero elements falling above the leading diagonal. The entire web contains entries both above and below the main diagonal and thus violates a central assumption of the cascade model.},

abstract = {Traffic accidents are a major cause of death and injury in the world. Generally speaking about aggression, evidence has shown that drivers who usually express aggressive behaviors more frequently tend, at the same time, to have higher rates of road crashes or traffic incidents. Furthermore, in most cases, the situations in which aggressive behaviors appear are typical of normal current traffic conditions, turning this behavior into something very common, and into a very serious road safety issue. This has also been related with the clear lack of Road Safety Education that is evident in most of the countries. The aim of this study was to describe the factors and perceptions related to the aggressive behavior of verbally insulting and shouting while driving. In this study, an extensive list of behaviors, that experts more or less unanimously consider as aggressive driving, was described; one of them was labeled shouting and insulting. The sample was obtained from a random sampling proportional to and representative of the segments of the population by age, sex, region and size of the municipality. The survey was aimed at Spanish drivers over 14 years. The starting sample size was 1,100 surveys. As a result, shouting and insulting is not considered such a dangerous offense as it is driving under the influence of alcohol, but we cannot deny that there are many types of bad or risky maneuvers that could be banned from a legal point of view. The degree of social tolerance towards such behavior is variable. Some individuals merely ignore them, accepting them as something inevitable. Multiple types of risky maneuvers and deliberated misbehaviors, which are (formally and informally) already forbidden from a legal point of view, make other drivers and pedestrians uncomfortable and restrict their movements, creating violent, stressful and risky situations, and they are still performed by drivers. In short, aggression in driving is one of them. As a conclusion, there is a high prevalence of this phenomenon among Spanish drivers. Furthermore, most of the aggressive expressions related to shouting and cursing on the road are preceded by subjective factors such as stress, fatigue and personality traits, which may be intervened through the strengthening of road safety education and road safety campaigns.},

abstract = {Functionally unique species contribute to the functional diversity of natural systems, often enhancing ecosystem functioning. An abundance of weakly interacting species increases stability in natural systems, suggesting that loss of weakly linked species may reduce stability. Any link between the functional uniqueness of a species and the strength of its interactions in a food web could therefore have simultaneous effects on ecosystem functioning and stability. Here, we analyse patterns in 213 real food webs and show that highly unique species consistently tend to have the weakest mean interaction strength per unit biomass in the system. This relationship is not a simple consequence of the interdependence of both measures on body size and appears to be driven by the empirical pattern of size structuring in aquatic systems and the trophic position of each species in the web. Food web resolution also has an important effect, with aggregation of species into higher taxonomic groups producing a much weaker relationship. Food webs with fewer unique and less weakly interacting species also show significantly greater variability in their levels of primary production. Thus, the loss of highly unique, weakly interacting species may eventually lead to dramatic state changes and unpredictable levels of ecosystem functioning. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Aim In a selected literature survey we reviewed studies on the habitat heterogeneity–animal species diversity relationship and evaluated whether there are uncertainties and biases in its empirical support. Location World-wide. Methods We reviewed 85 publications for the period 1960–2003. We screened each publication for terms that were used to define habitat heterogeneity, the animal species group and ecosystem studied, the definition of the structural variable, the measurement of vegetation structure and the temporal and spatial scale of the study. Main conclusions The majority of studies found a positive correlation between habitat heterogeneity/diversity and animal species diversity. However, empirical support for this relationship is drastically biased towards studies of vertebrates and habitats under anthropogenic influence. In this paper, we show that ecological effects of habitat heterogeneity may vary considerably between species groups depending on whether structural attributes are perceived as heterogeneity or fragmentation. Possible effects may also vary relative to the structural variable measured. Based upon this, we introduce a classification framework that may be used for across-studies comparisons. Moreover, the effect of habitat heterogeneity for one species group may differ in relation to the spatial scale. In several studies, however, different species groups are closely linked to ‘keystone structures' that determine animal species diversity by their presence. Detecting crucial keystone structures of the vegetation has profound implications for nature conservation and biodiversity management.},

The criteria focus on (a) acknowledging the role of assessment uncertainty, (b) incorporating time since introduction, (c) considering infraspecific taxonomic ranks, and (d) differentiating between alien species whose survival depends on explicit human assistance from those that survive without such assistance. Furthermore, we make recommendations for reducing assessment uncertainty, suggest thresholds for species assessment, and develop an assessment scheme. We illustrate the application of the assessment criteria with case studies. Finally, the implications for alien species management, policy, and research are discussed.},

Newts and Sirens had no effect on anuran species richness in SC. Instead, another salamander (Ambystoma talpoideum, mole salamander) absent from the NC ponds was identified as a strong keystone in SC. It functioned independently of environmental factors and the densities of other predators. Larval dragonflies (Tramea carolina, carolina saddlebag) were identified as weak, context-dependent keystones in SC, supporting anuran richness in isolated ponds with very low pH. The results suggest that the identity of keystone species varies, even in similar habitats within a physiographic region.},

abstract = {Conservation biology should focus more on the importance rather than the rarity of species, although the definition and quantification of importance are not easy. One approach involves measuring the positional importance (e.g. centrality) of species in ecological interaction networks to provide a basis for species ranking. However, there are many centrality indices, each reflecting a particular aspect of positional importance and therefore giving a rank order of species different from those provided by alternative formulations. Thus, there is a strong need for comparing the available indices and for examining their relative merits in network analysis. In this paper, we apply 13 centrality indices to the "species" (trophic components) of methodologically comparable trophic flow networks, in order to answer the following questions: (1) What is the disagreement between different indices regarding the rank of a given species in a given network? (2) How is this disagreement in performance influenced by the choice of the network? (3) What is the overall relationship among these indices and, in particular, which are the most similar to degree (the simplest index of all, being equal to the number of links pertaining to a given node)? We compare the 13 indices based on the data of nine networks using metric and rank statistics and multivariate analysis procedures. We conclude that (1) different centrality ranks differ in each network; (2) different webs can be characterized by different relationships between ranks but there is a robust pattern of relationships among the indices, some index pairs behaving very similarly in all networks; and (3) it is the index of closeness centrality which provides a rank most similar to that based on degree. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Predation shapes many fundamental aspects of ecology. Uncertainty remains, however, about whether predators can influence patterns of temporal niche construction at ecologically relevant timescales. Partitioning of time is an important mechanism by which prey avoid interactions with predators. However, the traits that control a prey organism's capacity to operate during a particular portion of the diel cycle are diverse and complex. Thus, diel prey niches are often assumed to be relatively unlikely to respond to changes in predation risk at short timescales. Here we present evidence to the contrary. We report results that suggest that the anthropogenic depletion of daytime active predators (species that are either diurnal or cathemeral) in a coral reef ecosystem is associated with rapid temporal niche expansions in a multi-species assemblage of nocturnal prey fishes. Diurnal comparisons of nocturnal prey fish abundance in predator rich and predator depleted reefs at two atolls revealed that nocturnal fish were approximately six (biomass) and eight (density) times more common during the day on predator depleted reefs. Amongst these, the prey species that likely were the most specialized for nocturnal living, and thus the most vulnerable to predation (i.e. those with greatest eye size to body length ratio), showed the strongest diurnal increases at sites where daytime active predators were rare. While we were unable to determine whether these observed increases in diurnal abundance by nocturnal prey were the result of a numerical or behavioral response, either effect could be ecologically significant. These results raise the possibility that predation may play an important role in regulating the partitioning of time by prey and that anthropogenic depletions of predators may be capable of causing rapid changes to key properties of temporal community architecture. {\textcopyright} 2012 McCauley et al.},

Understanding the relationship between complexity and stability of ecosystems is of key importance for the maintenance of the balance of human growth and the conservation of all the natural services that ecosystems provide. Mathematical network models can be used to simplify the vast complexity of the real world, to formally describe and investigate ecological phenomena, and to understand ecosystems propensity of returning to its functioning regime after a stress or a perturbation. The use of ecological-network models to study the relationship between complexity and stability of natural ecosystems is the focus of this review. The concept of ecological networks and their characteristics are first introduced, followed by central and occasionally contrasting definitions of complexity and stability. The literature on the relationship between complexity and stability in different types of models and in real ecosystems is then reviewed, highlighting the theoretical debate and the lack of consensual agreement. The summary of the importance of this line of research for the successful management and conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services concludes the review.},

A food web graphically represents the paths of nutrients and energy through the living components of an ecosystem and the context in which individuals exploit their prey and avoid their enemies. Temporary ponds are excellent arenas for the study of food webs because they are discrete communities that can be mimicked in containers that approach the realism of natural habitats. Artificial ponds permit repeatable initial con- ditions and sufficient replication of independent experimental units in complex experi- ments to test hypotheses about the control of structure and function in natural commu- nities. I used a combination of observations of natural ponds, "experimental natural history" of artificial ponds in my study area, and controlled experiments in an array of 144 replicate ponds to develop, then test, hypotheses about how the structures of food webs are regulated. Understanding food webs begins with population biology. Amphibians use the aquatic larval stage of their biphasic life cycle to exploit ephemeral opportunities for growth and development in temporary ponds.

abstract = {A new ecosystem-based climate envelope modeling approach was applied to assess potential climate change impacts on forest communities and tree species. Four orthogonal canonical discriminant functions were used to describe the realized climate space for British Columbia's ecosystems and to model portions of the realized niche space for tree species under current and predicted future climates. This conceptually simple model is capable of predicting species ranges at high spatial resolutions far beyond the study area, including outlying populations and southern range limits for many species. We analyzed how the realized climate space of current ecosystems changes in extent, elevation, and spatial distribution under climate change scenarios and evaluated the implications for potential tree species habitat. Tree species with their northern range limit in British Columbia gain potential habitat at a pace of at least 100 km per decade, common hardwoods appear to be generally unaffected by climate change, and some of the most important conifer species in British Columbia are expected to lose a large portion of their suitable habitat. The extent of spatial redistribution of realized climate space for ecosystems is considerable, with currently important sub-boreal and montane climate regions rapidly disappearing. Local predictions of changes to tree species frequencies were generated as a basis for systematic surveys of biological response to climate change.},

This paper investigates various ways of symmetrizing a directed graph into an undirected graph so that previous work on clustering undirected graphs may subsequently be leveraged. Recent work on clustering directed graphs has looked at generalizing objective functions such as conductance to directed graphs and minimizing such objective functions using spectral methods. We show that more meaningful clusters (as measured by an external ground truth criterion) can be obtained by symmetrizing the graph using measures that capture in- and out-link similarity, such as bibliographic coupling and co-citation strength. However, direct application of these similarity measures to modern large-scale power-law networks is problematic because of the presence of hub nodes, which become connected to the vast majority of the network in the transformed undirected graph. We carefully analyze this problem and propose a Degree-discounted similarity measure which is much more suitable for large-scale networks. We show extensive empirical validation.},

abstract = {Species are entangled within communities by their interactions in such a
manner that their local extinction may unchain coextinction cascades and
impact community dynamics and stability. Despite increasing attention,
simulation models to estimate the robustness of interaction networks
largely neglect the important role of interaction rewiring, that is, the
ability of species to switch partners. Here we propose a new method to
incorporate the potential of species to replace lost partners into a
widely used coextinction model to estimate network robustness. In this
model, species are allowed to rewire their interactions after initial
loss of partners according to probabilities derived from well-known
mechanisms that determine mutualistic interactions, for example, trait
matching, phenological overlap and abundances. To illustrate the use of
this method, we analyzed a well-sampled dataset of mutualistic
plant-hummingbird interactions. We found that (a) in general, rewiring
increases the estimated robustness, (b) networks are similarly robust to
the loss of pollinators or plants, (c) morphological matching and
phenological overlap leads to higher robustness, (d) when multiple
rewiring mechanisms are combined, however, robustness increases little,
and (e) rewiring tends to increase robustness more in scenarios when the
loss of generalist species occurs first. Our results suggest that the
same mechanisms known to drive plant-hummingbird network structure are
relevant in buffering the effects of species loss via rewiring. The
method proposed here can be applied to a wide range of interaction
networks and is flexible to the inclusion of other variables important
in determining interactions for specific systems. It also allows changes
on the assumptions regarding the importance of distinct mechanisms, for
instance including a hierarchical relationship, which facilitates
insights into the relative importance of multiple variables influencing
network disassembling. The analytical framework we offer here represents
a step towards a more realistic estimation on how species loss may
affect the integrity of interaction networks.},

The large biomass of many species ({\textgreater}1 kg body mass for the two raptors and some waterfowl) and enormous populations (e.g;, {\textgreater}1 million shorebirds in late May in parts of Delaware Bay) reveal the importance of waterbirds as consumers and as linkages in nutrient flux in many shallow-water habitats. Salt and brackish marsh shallow-water habitats, including marsh pannes and tidal pools and creeks as well as constructed impoundments, are used intensively during most months of the year; in fall and winter, mostly by dabbling ducks, in spring and summer by migrant shorebirds and breeding colonial wading birds and seabirds. In adjacent estuaries, the intertidal flats and littoral zones of shallow embayments are heavily used by shorebirds, raptors, and colonial waterbirds in the May to September periods, with use by duck and geese heaviest from October to March. With the regional-degradation of estuarine habitats and population declines of many species of waterbirds in the past 20 yr, some management recommendations relevant to shallow waters include: better protection, enhancement, and creation of small bay islands (small and isolated to preclude most mammalian predators) for nesting and brooding birds, especially colonial species; establishment of sanctuaries from human disturbance (e.g., boating; hunting) both in open water (waterfowl) and on land; better allocation of sandy dredged materials to augment islands or stabilize eroding islands; improvement in water management of existing impoundments to ensure good feeding; resting, and nesting opportunities for all the waterbirds; support for policies to preclude point and nonpoint source runoff of chemicals and nutrients to enable submerged aquatic vegetation to recover in many coastal bays; and improvement in environmental education concerning disturbance to wildlife for boaters and recreationists using the coastal zone.},

Based on the mixture models and the exploratory analysis set up by Newman and Leicht (2007 Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 104 9564), we develop an algorithm that is applicable to a network with any degree distribution. The partition of a network suggested by this algorithm also applies to its complementary network. In general, groups of similar components are not necessarily identical with the communities in a community network; thus partitioning a network into groups of similar components provides additional information of the network structure. The proposed algorithm can also be used for community detection when the groups and the communities overlap. By introducing a tunable parameter that controls the involved effects of the heterogeneity, we can also investigate conveniently how the group structure can be coupled with the heterogeneity characteristics. In particular, an interesting example shows a group partition can evolve into a community partition in some situations when the involved heterogeneity effects are tuned. The extension of this algorithm to weighted networks is discussed as well. {\textcopyright} IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

abstract = {We present the first synthesis of the life history and ecology of seahorses, compare relationships for seahorses with other marine teleosts and identify research needs. Seahorses occurred primarily amidst temperate seagrasses and tropical coral reefs. Population densities were generally low, ranging from 0 to 0-51 individuals m(-2), but reached 10 m(-2) in some patches. Inferred life spans ranged from I to 5 years. Seahorses consumed live prey and possibly changed diet as they grew. Growth rates are poorly investigated to date. Reproduction and mating systems are the best-studied aspects of seahorse ecology. The relationship between size at first maturity and maximum size in seahorses conformed to that for other marine teleosts. All seahorse species were monogamous within a cycle, but some were polygamous across cycles. Direct transfer of clutches to the brood pouch of the male fish made it difficult to measure clutch size in live seahorses. After brooding, males released from c. 5 to 2000 young, depending on species and adult size. Newborn young measured from 2 to 20 mm in length, which was a narrower size range than the 17-fold difference that occurred in adult size. Newborn body size had no relationship to adult size. Both eggs and young were larger than expected among marine teleosts, even when considering only those with parental care, but brood size at release was lower than expected, perhaps because the young were more developed. The size of adults, eggs and young increased with increasing latitude, although brood size did not. Considerable research is needed to advance seahorse conservation and management, including (a) fisheries-dependent and fisheries-independent abundance estimates, (b) age- or stage-based natural and fishing mortalities, (c) growth rates and age at first maturity, and (d) intrinsic rates of increase and age- or size-specific reproductive output. Current data confirm that seahorses are likely to be vulnerable to, high levels of exploitation. (C) 2004 The Fisheries Society of the British Isles.},

abstract = {Although most researchers use the terms "guild" and "functional group" more or less synonymously, these two concepts bear different meanings. The guild concept refers primarily to the mechanisms of resource sharing by species in a competitive context whereas the functional groups concept is concerned with how a resource or any other ecological component is processed by different species to provide a specific ecosystem service or function. In many cases but not necessarily all, the two concepts are the two "facesquot; or "sides" of the same coin: the sharing by species of a similar resource is the guild facet (structural), while the ecosystem processes these species eventually perform through resource exploitation is the functional group facet. The two concepts differ in that competitive relationships within groups of species are not the focus of the functional group approach, exactly as processes or functions are not the focus of the guild approach. A group of species can be considered either as a guild or a functional group depending on the question addressed. Guild and functional group membership is independent of phylogenetic relationships but because species tend to share similar life history traits and adaptations through common evolutionary history, guild and functional group associates are often closely related. The concept of guild has had broader application in animal studies than in plant studies, whereas the reverse is true for the concept of functional group. Recent methodological advances to objectively partition species into guilds and functional groups, taking into consideration the most relevant characters or traits for delineating them, provide the means to construct an operational framework for making in situ and ex situ experiments that are urgently needed for a better understanding of the role of species in ecosystem functioning, especially in relation to global change concerns.},

abstract = {This study assessed riparian vegetation as a source of energy in different ponds. The trophic importance of food sources from the riparian zones for invertebrate consumers was analysed using the dual stable isotope technique. We measured stable carbon ($\delta$13C) and nitrogen ($\delta$15N) isotope values for three energy sources and primary consumers in four ponds in NWSpain to determine food sources that support primary consumers. Samples of littoral macroinvertebrates, macrophytes, epiphyton, and riparian vegetation were collected during two periods (summer 2010 and summer 2011) at each site.We used the MixSIR Bayesian mixing model to model the contribution of potential food sources of organic carbon supporting primary consumers at the study sites. The $\delta$13C signatures of food sources varied between -35.5 ‰ and -20.76 ‰ , whereas the $\delta$15N signatures ranged from -6.2 h to 11.27 h. Primary consumer isotope signatures corrected for the discrimination factor were within the range of the isotope values of the potential food sources in three of the ponds. Significant differences were observed in $\delta$13C and $\delta$15N signatures among sources at each site and overall ( p {\textless} 0.05). Significant differences were also found among sampling sites for each source separately and for overall food sources ( p {\textless} 0.05). TheMixSIR Bayesian stable isotope mixing model indicated that riparian vegetation and epiphyton were the most important production sources supporting the biomass of invertebrates overall. In addition, riparian vegetation and epiphyton were, most likely, a food source in the three ponds. Macrophytes were an unlikely food source for invertebrates in all ponds, although they could have some importance as a source in the Bodeira pond.},

As expected for a sit-and-wait predator, resting lions spent more time in areas with good cover. On a broad-scale, lions shifted their ranges according to the seasonal movement of prey, but at a finer scale ({\textless} 100 m) lions fed in areas with high prey 'catchability' rather than high prey density. Plains lions selected erosion embankments, view-sheds from rocky outcrops, and access to free water. Woodland lions tended to use erosion embankments, and woody vegetation. 4.

abstract = {Plant introductions and subsequent community shifts are known to affect nutrient cycling, but most such studies have focused on nutrient enrichment effects. The nature of plant-driven nutrient depletions and the mechanisms by which these might occur are relatively poorly understood. In this study we demonstrate that the proliferation of the commonly introduced coconut palm, Cocos nucifera, interrupts the flow of allochthonous marine subsidies to terrestrial ecosystems via an indirect effect: impact on birds. Birds avoid nesting or roosting in C. nucifera, thus reducing the critical nutrient inputs they bring from the marine environment. These decreases in marine subsidies then lead to reductions in available soil nutrients, decreases in leaf nutrient quality, diminished leaf palatability, and reduced herbivory. This nutrient depletion pathway contrasts the more typical patterns of nutrient enrichment that follow plant species introductions. Research on the effects of spatial subsidy disruptions on ecosystems has not yet examined interruptions driven by changes within the recipient community, such as plant community shifts. The ubiquity of coconut palm introductions across the tropics and subtropics makes these observations particularly noteworthy. Equally important, the case of C. nucifera provides a strong demonstration of how plant community changes can dramatically impact the supply of allochthonous nutrients and thereby reshape energy flow in ecosystems.},

abstract = {Studies in lakes show that fish and crayfish predators play an important role in determining the abundance of freshwater snails. In contrast, there are few studies of snails and their predators in shallow ponds and marshes. Ponds often lack fish and crayfish but have abundant insect populations. Here we present the results of field surveys, laboratory foraging trials, and an outdoor mesocosm experiment, testing the hypothesis that insects are important predators of pulmonate snails. In laboratory foraging trials, conducted with ten species of insects, most insect taxa consumed snails, and larval dragonflies were especially effective predators. The field surveys showed that dragonflies constitute the majority of the insect biomass in fishless ponds. More focused foraging trials evaluated the ability of the dragonflies Anax junius and Pantala hymenaea to prey upon different sizes and species of pulmonate snails (Helisoma trivolvis, Physa acuta, and Stagnicola elodes). Anax junius consumed all three species up to the maximum size tested. Pantala hymenaea consumed snails with a shell height of 3 mm and smaller, but did not kill larger snails. P. acuta were more vulnerable to predators than were H. trivolvis or S. elodes. In the mesocosm experiment, conducted with predator treatments of A. junius, P. hymenaea, and the hemipteran Belostoma flumineum, insect predators had a pronounced negative effect on snail biomass and density. A. junius and B. flumineum reduced biomass and density to a similar degree, and both reduced biomass more than did P. hymenaea. Predators did not have a strong effect on species composition. A model suggested that A. junius and P. hymenaea have the largest effects on snail biomass in the field. Given that both pulmonate snails and dragonfly nymphs are widespread and abundant in marshes and ponds, snail assemblages in these water bodies are likely regulated in large part by odonate predation. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer-Verlag.},

We differentiate historical and contemporary views, and characterize physical and ecological processes that create and maintain climate change refugia. We then delineate how refugia can fit into existing decision support frameworks for climate adaptation and describe seven steps for managing them.

abstract = {Among the most popular reasons that people feed wild birds is that they want to help birds. The extent to which supplemental food helps birds, however, is not well established. From spring 2011 to spring 2014, we examined how feeding of wild birds influences the health of individual birds at forested sites in central Illinois, USA. Specifically, we compared three forested sites where we provided supplemental food with three forested sites for which no supplemental food was available and monitored changes in the individual health of birds. In addition, we determined whether any changes in bird health had occurred after feeders had been removed from sites 10 months before. Generally, the individual health of birds improved with supplemental feeding, including increased antioxidant levels, reduced stress (heterophil-to-lymphocyte ratio) and more rapid feather growth. In some species, we also found improved body condition index scores and innate immune defense. The difference among sites was not present 10 months after feeders were removed, suggesting that the impact on health was indeed related to supplemental feeding. Potential negative effects of supplemental feeding were also found, including an increase in infectious disease prevalence among individual birds at forested sites where supplemental food was offered. Birds with clear signs of pathology showed deficits in most of the physiological metrics in which birds at feeder sites typically showed improved health condition. At the peak of prevalence of infectious disease, 8.3{\%} of all birds at feeders exhibited symptoms of conjunctivitis, pox, dermal disease or cloacal disease. We found both positive and negative impacts of wild bird feeding, and that, in general, birds that had access to supplemental food were in better physiological condition. Moreover, the negative effects we found may be mitigated by hobbyists engaging in safer bird-feeding practices.},

We test this space-for-time assumption by combining a spatial gradient study with whole-community turf transplantation along temperature and precipitation gradients in a network of 12 grassland sites in Southern Norway. Using data on eight traits for 169 species and annual vegetation censuses of 235 turfs over 5 yr, we quantify trait-based responses to climate change by comparing observed community dynamics in transplanted turfs to feld-parameterized null model simulations. Three traits related to species architecture (maximum height, number of dormant meristems, and rametramet connection persistence) varied consistently along spatial temperature gradients and also correlated to changes in species abundances in turfs transplanted to warmer climates. Two traits associated with resource acquisition strategy (SLA, leaf area) increased along spatial temperature gradients but did not correlate to changes in species abundances following warming. No traits correlated consistently with precipitation. Our study supports the hypothesis that spatial associations between plant traits and broad-scale climate variables can be predictive of community response to climate change, but it also suggests that not all traits with clear patterns along climate gradients will necessarily influence community response to an equal degree.},

We define keystone and burden communities as communities with impacts disproportionately large (positive or negative respectively) relative to their weight in the metacommunity. We show how a simple metric, based on the effects of single-community removals, can characterise communities along a 'keystoneness' axis. We illustrate the usefulness of this approach with examples from two different theoretical models. We further distinguish environmental heterogeneity from species trait heterogeneity as determinants of keystoneness.

abstract = {The loss of species from ecological communities can unleash a cascade of
secondary extinctions, the risk and extent of which are likely to depend
on the traits of the species that are lost from the community. To
identify species traits that have the greatest impact on food web
robustness to species loss we here subject allometrically scaled,
dynamical food web models to several deletion sequences based on
species' connectivity, generality, vulnerability or body mass. Further,
to evaluate the relative importance of dynamical to topological effects
we compare robustness between dynamical and purely topological models.
This comparison reveals that the topological approach overestimates
robustness in general and for certain sequences in particular. Top-down
directed sequences have no or very low impact on robustness in
topological analyses, while the dynamical analysis reveals that they may
be as important as high-impact bottom-up directed sequences. Moreover,
there are no deletion sequences that result, on average, in no or very
few secondary extinctions in the dynamical approach. Instead, the least
detrimental sequence in the dynamical approach yields an average
robustness similar to the most detrimental (non-basal) deletion sequence
in the topological approach. Hence, a topological analysis may lead to
erroneous conclusions concerning both the relative and the absolute
importance of different species traits for robustness. The dynamical
sequential deletion analysis shows that food webs are least robust to
the loss of species that have many trophic links or that occupy low
trophic levels. In contrast to previous studies we can infer, albeit
indirectly, that secondary extinctions were triggered by both bottom-up
and top-down cascades.},

In total, 35 macroinvertebrate species were found with Chironomidae the dominant taxonomic group. Macroinvertebrate density increased significantly with temperature. Dominant species in the warm streams were Lymnaea peregra and Simulium vittatum. Algal biomass, macrophyte cover and richness were unrelated to temperature. Densities of trout (Salmo trutta), the only fish species present, reflected habitat conditions and to a lesser degree temperature. 3. Density of filter-feeders increased significantly with temperature whereas scraper density, the other dominant functional feeding group, was unrelated to temperature.

ABSTARCT
The degree of territoriality depended by the distribution of the food sources, the size of the food source and the length of time at which these sources produce the food (Bennett, 1986). The home range depends by the food availability (Bennett, 1986).

INTRODUCTION
The home range of primates depends by a lot of factors. It can vary among different species, different habitats, different groups. The factors that might influence it are (Bennett, 1986): 
- weather

- need to patrol territorial boundaries
- the group's movements on previous days
- inter-group interactions and avoidance
- food availability (especially)

DISCUSSION: Intergroup tollerance and range overlap

The monkeys might haven not defended the rare food sources because they had to move around without being able to defend all the sources. However, why didn't they defend the food sources when they met the other groups?
The defendability index (D more than 1 then home range highly defendable) of Sumatran Surili has been found to be 1.4 in Kuala Lompat. 
The defendability considers the home range as a circle and it depends by the area of the circle and by the movements of the group.
Sumatran Surili have been found to eat young leaves and reproductive parts of the trees.
The food sources of Sumatran Surili have been found to be highly seasonal, widely distributed and when they were available they provided abundant items. 
During the year, the monkeys had to move around because of the wide distribution of their food sources. This meant to have a really large home range. 
At any moment there was several big trees that provided enough food to the Sumatran Surili. In fact, there was more food than they could eat. This is why they let other groups to enter their home range and use their resources. 
The interactions between groups happened when seasonal, scattered and abundant food was available. Then the different groups fed on different plants. The reason could have been: 1. groups are no longer attracted by abundant food sources 2. groups are more territorial 

DISCUSSION: Intraspecific variation in ranging and territoriality

Differences in territoriality across habitats and time have been found in primates. They have been tried to be explained by 1. Population density 2. Food sources density and distribution 3. Predation pressure
Predation pressure in Sumatran Surili is really low. No hunting pressure has been registered since in 1951-1986 and only one predation by non-humans has been registered in 1964-1986.
Higher availability of food might cause a smaller home range where all the individuals are close together and their density is higher. 
Here the monkeys showed higher territoriality probably because of the food availability. It seemed that most of the trees were scattered and produced a small amount of fruits. If an other group would have entered in their territory, they would have had to travel around to find a new food source and the amount of food available would have been less. That is probably why the monkeys fed almost exclusively on their home ranges.},

abstract = {Seagrasses are marine flowering plants found in shallow coastal habitats around the world. These plants create a habitat of substantial importance from an ecological, economic and biodiversity point of view. Unfortunately, there have been considerable losses of seagrass habitat worldwide, leading to increasing interest on the development of seagrass restoration and rehabilitation projects. These projects, often developed as a mitigation tool, deeply benefit from the spatially explicit information included in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Thus, to have seagrass area estimates for transplanting purposes and, to be able to monitor transplanting impacts, a large-scale GIS map was build for Sado and Mira River Estuaries, Portinho da Arr{\'{a}}bida Bay and Ria Formosa regions using: (1) aerial photography analysis, (2) photo-interpretation, (3) on-site groundtruthing surveys and (4) statistical analysis. Habitat boundaries were evaluated through aerial photography, and a complete set of selected sites were visited for groundtruth validation, using 4 types of transect methods (along the shore-line, free-diving, scuba diving and boat transects). Twelve thousand, six hundred and fifty two hectares (12652.17 ha) were assessed, 3944 groundtruth points were recorded and 3 seagrass species were identified and mapped (Zostera marina, Zostera noltii and Cymodocea nodosa). Ria Formosa had the largest distribution area of seagrass species (241.04 ha), followed by Sado Estuary (32.68 ha). Mira Estuary had only one seagrass meadow and in Portinho da Arr{\'{a}}bida Bay no seagrass meadows were registered. Zostera noltii was the most abundant species in both regions, followed by Cymodocea nodosa and Zostera marina. The error assessment for species distribution area and diversity, estimated through kappa statistics based on error matrices, gave a perfect agreement value (K=0.912) to the methodology used.},

Network research has traditionally focused on a single interaction type at a time (e.g. food webs, mutualistic networks). Networks comprising different types of interactions have recently started to be empirically characterized. Patterns observed in these networks and their implications for stability demand for further theoretical investigations. Here, we employed a spatially explicit model to disentangle the effects of mutualism/antagonism ratios in food web dynamics and stability. We found that increasing levels of plant-animal mutualistic interactions generally resulted in more stable communities. More importantly, increasing the proportion of mutualistic vs. antagonistic interactions at the base of the food web affects different aspects of ecological stability in different directions, although never negatively. Stability is either not influenced by increasing mutualism—for the cases of population stability and species' spatial distributions—or is positively influenced by it—for spatial aggregation of species. Additionally, we observe that the relative increase of mutualistic relationships decreases the strength of biotic interactions in general within the ecological network. Our work highlights the importance of considering several dimensions of stability simultaneously to understand the dynamics of communities comprising multiple interaction types.},

Because top predators often exert strong influence on their prey populations their extinction can have far-reaching consequences for the structure and functioning of ecosystems. It has, for example, been observed that the local loss of a predator can trigger a cascade of secondary extinctions. However, the time lags involved in such secondary extinctions remain unexplored. Here we show that the loss of a top predator leads to a significantly earlier onset of secondary extinctions in model communities than does the loss of a species from other trophic levels. Moreover, in most cases time to secondary extinction increases with increasing species richness. If local secondary extinctions occur early they are less likely to be balanced by immigration of species from local communities nearby. The implications of these results for community persistence and conservation priorities are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

This could alter energy fluxes3–5 and even amplify extinction rates within the food web6–8.

Here, we tested this hypothesis by characterizing around 50,000 directly observed feeding interactions across 14 naturally heated stream ecosystems11–15. We found that higher temperature simplified food-web structure and shortened the pathways of energy flux between consumers and resources. A simple allometric diet breadth model10,16 predicted 68–82{\%} of feeding interactions and the effects of warming on key food-web properties. We used model simulations to identify the underlying mechanism as a change in the relative diversity and abundance of consumers and their resources. This model shows how warming can reduce the stability of aquatic ecosystems by eroding the structural integrity of the food web. Given these fundamental drivers, such responses are expected to be manifested more broadly and could be predicted using our modelling framework and knowledge of how warming alters some routinely measured characteristics of organisms.},

abstract = {Human involvement in food webs has been profound, bringing about enormous and disproportionate losses of large apex predators on land and in water. The losses have modified or even eliminated concatenations of indirect interactions propagating from predators to herbivores to plants, inter alia. Food webs are a synthesis of bottom-up energy and nutrient flow from plant producers to consumers and top-down regulation of producers by consumers. The trophic cascade is the simplest top-down interaction and accounts for a great deal of what is known about food webs. In three-link cascades, predators suppress herbivores, releasing plants. In longer cascades, predators can suppress smaller mesopredators, releasing their prey animals. Hunting, fishing, and whaling have brought parallel losses of large apex predators to food webs. Without apex predators, smaller mesopredators have often become superabundant, sometimes with unprecedented suppression of their prey, extinctions, and endangerment. Flourishing mesopredators also can reverse the web regulation and suppress apex predators that have become rare owing to hunting and fishing. This can prevent fisheries recovery and lead to persistent alternative ecosystem states. Although food-web modules of large animals are increasingly well understood, the parts of webs consisting of small inconspicuous organisms, such as mutualists and parasites, and webs in obscure places, such as in the soil, are much of the challenge of future research.},

abstract = {Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM) aims to support the protection of natural ecosystems and to improve economic activities. It requires considering all of the actors interacting in social-ecological systems (e.g., fish and fishers) in the understanding that their interplay determines the dynamic behavior of the single actors as well as that of the system as a whole. Connections are thus central to EBM. Within the ecological dimension of socio-ecological systems, interactions between species define such connections. Understanding how connections affect ecosystem and species dynamics is often impaired by a lack of data. We propose food web network analysis as a tool to help bridge the gap between EBM theory and practice in data-poor contexts, and illustrate this approach through its application to a coastal marine ecosystem in Baja California Sur, Mexico. First, we calculated centrality indices to identify which key (i.e., most central) species must be considered when designing strategies for sustainable resource management. Second, we analyzed the resilience of the system by measuring changes in food web structure due to the local extinction of vulnerable species (i.e., by mimicking the possible effect of excessive fishing pressure). The consequences of species removals were quantified in terms of impacts on global structural indices and species' centrality indices. Overall, we found that this coastal ecosystem shows high resilience to species loss. We identified species (e.g., Octopus sp. and the kelp bass, Paralabrax clathratus) whose protection could further decrease the risk of potential negative impacts of fishing activities on the Baja California Sur food web. This work introduces an approach that can be applied to other ecosystems to aid the implementation of EBM in data-poor contexts.},

abstract = {Despite a strong interest in fen management across temperate regions worldwide, fen plant population dynamics have not been examined in relation to succession and disturbance in North America. However, a number of rare perennials in North American fens are commonly believed to decline as these wetlands transition from open to closed canopy habitats. We investigated the applicability of existing European fen studies to North American fens by focusing on the population dynamics of one of these rare perennials, . Trollius laxus (Ranunculaceae). We used projection matrix modeling to examine the subpopulation dynamics of . T. laxus in created experimental canopy gaps, paired controls, and naturally occurring gaps in a forested fen; and compared the population dynamics of . T. laxus to those of European perennial herbs that occupy traditionally managed fens and wet grasslands. On average, . T. laxus subpopulations responded to experimental canopy gaps with first increasing, then declining stem and flower production and overall demographic success (i.e., population growth rate, . $\lambda$). Competition from surrounding understory vegetation and litter accumulation were likely the major factors causing the declines. Life table response experiments revealed the importance of growth and stasis to differences in . $\lambda$ among . T. laxus subpopulations. The demography of . T. laxus was similar in several key ways to the demography of European species from fens and wet grasslands, suggesting that active management may be needed in many North American fens in order to conserve the rare and uncommon plants that are characteristic of these habitats. This active management might include establishing mowing, grazing, or selective logging practices that mimic traditional agricultural activities, while also reducing fertilizer runoff. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The existence of so great a diversity of species on Earth remains a mystery, the solution to which may also explain why and how biodiversity influences the functioning of ecosystems. The answer may lie in quantifying the trade-offs that organisms face in dealing with the constraints of their environment. Societal responses to the loss of biodiversity also involve trade-offs, and the elaboration of these will be essential in developing wiser environmental ethics and policy.},
annote = {One of the main questions of conservation biology is whether stability and other ecosystem function depend upon biodiversity. Even if this question has been raised only at the beginning of the 90s, a lot of work has already been done about it. 
  
The effects of biodiversity on ecosystems 
Biodiversity has been found to be correlated with: 
-       Ecosystem stability 
-       Plant productivity and nutrient retention. Higher biodiversity of plants is associated with higher retention of limiting nutrients in the soil (stopping leaching), which increases the productivity of the plant community. 
  
Why ecosystems are more stable at higher biodiversity can be due to three things: 
-       Portfolio effect. Wait, I thought that the species abundances were covarying because of competition, so they shouldn't vary independently. Or maybe some vary independently, and some don't. 
-       Covariance due to competition. Abundances covary because of competition. When the abundance of a certain species decreases it releases the other species from the competition pressure and its abundance increases. It's called ecological release. 
-       Stability is calculated as the ratio between community abundance and standard deviation. Higher biodiversity is associated with higher abundance, making the ratio higher and the stability higher. Why does an increase in biodiversity cause an increase in the total abundance? 
  
Ecosystem functioning depends by: 
-       Biodiversity 
-       Species composition 
-       Climate 
-       Soil type 
-       Disturbance regime 
  
The effects of coexistence on ecosystem functioning 
Having understood that biodiversity is important for ecosystem functioning, now it's time to protect it. However, to protect it we need to understand which are the mechanisms that maintain it. To understand it we need to focus on the interaction between different individuals of different species. Probably, the best explanation is that species can live in an environment by balancing different trade-offs. The main ones are: 
-       Trade-off between competitive ability and dispersal ability 
-       Trade-off between competitive ability and susceptibility to diseases/predation 
-       Trade-off between ability of living off average conditions and exploiting resource pulses 
-       Trade-off between ability of competing for alternative resources in a heterogeneous environment 
  
Niche differentiation also is one of the mechanisms that maintain biodiversity. The more a landscape is heterogenous the more niches there will be and the more species and taxa it will be possible to find there. It seems that niche differentiation is more present than antagonistic relationships among species. So, niche differentiation might be the main process by which communities are structured. 
  
Societal trade-offs and ethics 
60{\%} of all the human calories comes from wheat, rice and corn.  We need to protect their genetic variability in the future so that they don't get extinct because of diseases or pesticide-resistant crops. To do this we should mix them with wild varieties. 
  
The interaction of humans with nature has always pros and cons. What we need to do is balancing them. These have and will change because of different conditions of the planet and of human societies. The laws that we have right now have been written when the impact of humans on the planet was way potentially way smaller. Also, as we enter deeper in the Anthropocene our impact will have bigger effects on the planet (I add because we have made it weaker or because we are moving toward the tipping point). 
  
Science should contribute to the discourse even if academia doesn't value these kind of things as it values peer-reviewed articles.},

These portfolio effects derive from statistical averaging across the dynamics of system components, which often correlate weakly or negatively with each other through time and space. The "portfolio" concept when applied to ecological research provides important insights into how ecosystems are organized, how species interact, and how evolutionary strategies develop. It also helps identify appropriate scales for developing robust management and conservation schemes, and offers an approach that does not rely on prescriptive predictions about threats in an uncertain future. Rather, it presents a framework for managing risk from inevitable perturbations, many of which we will not be able to understand or anticipate.},

abstract = {Climate change research has demonstrated that changing temperatures will have an effect on community-level dynamics by altering species survival rates, shifting species distributions, and ultimately, creating mismatches in community interactions. However, most of this work has focused on increasing temperature, and still little is known about how the variation in temperature extremes will affect community dynamics. We used the model aquatic community held within the leaves of the carnivorous plant, Sarracenia purpurea, to test how food web dynamics will be affected by high temperature variation. We tested the community response of the first (bacterial density), second (protist diversity and composition), and third trophic level (predator mortality), and measured community respiration. We collected early and late successional stage inquiline communities from S. purpurea from two North American and two European sites with similar average July temperature. We then created a common garden experiment in which replicates of these communities underwent either high or normal daily temperature variation, with the average temperature equal among treatments. We found an impact of temperature variation on the first two, but not on the third trophic level. For bacteria in the high-variation treatment, density experienced an initial boost in growth but then decreased quickly through time. For protists in the high-variation treatment, alpha-diversity decreased faster than in the normal-variation treatment, beta-diversity increased only in the European sites, and protist community composition tended to diverge more in the late successional stage. The mortality of the predatory mosquito larvae was unaffected by temperature variation. Community respiration was lower in the high-variation treatment, indicating a lower ecosystem functioning. Our results highlight clear impacts of temperature variation. A more mechanistic understanding of the effects that temperature, and especially temperature variation, will have on community dynamics is still greatly needed.},

abstract = {There are potential advantages of housing primates in mixed species exhibits for both the visiting public and the primates themselves. If the primates naturally associate in the wild, it may be more educational and enjoyable for the public to view. Increases in social complexity and stimulation may be enriching for the primates. However, mixed species exhibits might also create welfare problems such as stress from interspecific aggression. We present data on the behavior of single and mixed species groups of capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) and squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus) housed at the Living Links to Human Evolution Research Centre in the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland's Edinburgh Zoo. These species associate in the wild, gaining foraging benefits and decreased predation. But Cebus are also predators themselves with potential risks for the smaller Saimiri. To study their living together we took scan samples at Z15 min intervals on single (n 5 109) and mixed species groups (n 5 152), and all occurrences of intraspecific aggression and interspecific interactions were recorded. We found no evidence of chronic stress and Saimiri actively chose to associate with Cebus. On 79{\%} of scans, the two species simultaneously occupied the same part of their enclosure. No vertical displacement was observed. Interspecific interactions were common ({\textgreater}2.5/hr), and equally divided among mildly aggressive, neutral, and affiliative interactions such as play. Only one aggressive interaction involved physical contact and was non-injurious. Aggressive interactions were mostly (65{\%}) displacements and vocal exchanges, initiated almost equally by Cebus and Saimiri. Modifications to the enclosure were successful in reducing these mildly aggressive interactions with affiliative interactions increasing in frequency and diversity. Our data suggest that in carefully designed, large enclosures, naturally associating monkeys are able to live harmoniously and are enriched by each other. Am.},

The pattern of bifurcations away from the equilibrium point is investigated and the existence of a "strange attractor" is demonstrated - i.e. an attracting limit set which is neither an equilibrium nor a limit cycle. Near the strange attractor the system exhibits essentially random behavior. An approach to the statistical analysis of the dynamics in the chaotic regime is suggested. We then generalize our conclusions to higher dimensions and continuous models (e.g. the nonlinear von Foerster equation). {\textcopyright} 1977 Springer-Verlag.},

Exploring three approaches in which the estimated probability of extinction shows a power- law relationship with geographical range size, we predict, on the basis of mid-range climate-warming scenarios for 2050, that 15–37{\%} of species in our sample of regions and taxa will be ‘committed to extinction'. When the average ofthe three methods and two dispersal scenarios is taken, minimal climate-warming scenarios produce lower projections of species committed to extinction (,18{\%}) than mid-range (,24{\%}) and maximum- change (,35{\%}) scenarios. These estimates show the importance of rapid implementation of technologies to decrease greenhouse gas emissions and strategies for carbon sequestration.},

abstract = {Inducible defenses are dynamic traits that modulate the strength of both plant-herbivore and herbivore-carnivore interactions. Surprisingly few studies have considered the relative contributions of induced plant and herbivore defenses to the overall balance of bottom-up and top-down control. Here we compare trophic cascade strengths using replicated two-level and three-level plankton communities in which we systematically varied the presence or absence of induced defenses at the plant and/or herbivore levels. Our results show that a trophic cascade, i.e., significantly higher plant biomass in three-level than in two-level food chains, occurred whenever herbivores were undefended against carnivores. Trophic cascades did not occur when herbivores exhibited an induced defense. This pattern was obtained irrespective of the presence or absence of induced defenses at the plant level. We thus found that herbivore defenses, not plant defenses, had an overriding effect on cascade strength. We discuss these results in relation to variation in cascade strengths in natural communities. {\textcopyright} 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.},

To date, however, we are lacking empirical knowledge of the extent to which genetic variation determines the assembly of ecological networks, as well as how the gain or loss of genetic variation will affect network structure. To address this knowledge gap, we used a common garden experiment to quantify the extent to which heritable trait variation in a host plant determines the assembly of its associated insect food web (network of trophic interactions). We then used a resampling procedure to simulate the additive effects of genetic variation on overall food-web complexity. We found that trait variation among host-plant genotypes was associated with resistance to insect herbivores, which indirectly affected interactions between herbivores and their insect parasitoids.

abstract = {Aim In a selected literature survey we reviewed studies on the habitat heterogeneity–animal species diversity relationship and evaluated whether there are uncertainties and biases in its empirical support. Location World-wide. Methods We reviewed 85 publications for the period 1960–2003. We screened each publication for terms that were used to define habitat heterogeneity, the animal species group and ecosystem studied, the definition of the structural variable, the measurement of vegetation structure and the temporal and spatial scale of the study. Main conclusions The majority of studies found a positive correlation between habitat heterogeneity/diversity and animal species diversity. However, empirical support for this relationship is drastically biased towards studies of vertebrates and habitats under anthropogenic influence. In this paper, we show that ecological effects of habitat heterogeneity may vary considerably between species groups depending on whether structural attributes are perceived as heterogeneity or fragmentation. Possible effects may also vary relative to the structural variable measured. Based upon this, we introduce a classification framework that may be used for across-studies comparisons. Moreover, the effect of habitat heterogeneity for one species group may differ in relation to the spatial scale. In several studies, however, different species groups are closely linked to ‘keystone structures' that determine animal species diversity by their presence. Detecting crucial keystone structures of the vegetation has profound implications for nature conservation and biodiversity management.},

abstract = {The local extinction or large fluctuation in abundance of a species may seriously affect other species in the community. The effects spread through the community by direct and indirect interactions. The network perspective on ecology can help map the pathways of these effects, for food webs, the pathways of indirect trophic interactions. Indirect interactions typically decay in intensity as they spread. Therefore, there is a conceptual maximum range in topological space beyond which interactions have no effects, even though all species remain connected. Neither the local characteristics of species, nor the global characteristics of entire webs, suitably quantify this range. We therefore apply intermediate scale indices that reflect the limitations imposed by effect damping in networks. We present a complex analysis of the topological positional importance of species in the Chesapeake Bay web. This web is a carbon-flow network that represents trophic interactions. We present several different indices reflecting different properties and discuss which questions the different indices best answer. We look for the best indices for identifying the key players in ecosystem functioning. Our study contributes to the quantification of relative species importance and provides an exact and a priori determination of a class of candidate keystone species that can inform applied and conservation ecology as well as theoretical concerns.},

abstract = {The degree to which tree species will shift in response to climate change is uncertain yet critical to understand for assessing ecosystem vulnerability. We analyze results from recent studies that model potential tree species habitat across the eastern United States during the coming century. Our goals were to quantify and spatially analyze habitat projections and their congruence under multiple climate scenarios and to assess the implications of habitat change for forest vulnerability and adaptation to climate change in and around protected areas. We assessed habitat projections of species habitat extent and forest composition for 35 tree species under climate change from 2000 to 2100 within National Park Service management units in the Appalachian Landscape Conservation Cooperative (ALCC), spanning an approximately 1,500 km latitudinal gradient. Our results show that forest composition and species ranges could change substantially under all greenhouse gas emissions scenarios and that model correspondence was stronger for projections of habitat declines than increases. Model correspondence generally increased at finer spatial scales, but varied by tree species and focal area. In the ALCC, forest composition was projected to change the most in protected area centered ecosystems (PACEs). Northeastern PACEs were projected to be suitable for tree species currently in southeastern PACEs, suggesting that intermediate suitable habitat regions could promote tree species persistence and mitigate the impacts of climate change on eastern forests. These results suggest that climate-specific management of eastern U.S. forest ecosystems will be critical but challenging, requiring integrated assessment and management of PACEs and protected areas as well as higher-resolution monitoring and modeling to inform spatially explicit management decisions within eastern U.S. parks.},

abstract = {Decreasing rate of migration in several species as a consequence of climate change and anthropic pressure, together with increasing evidence of space-use strategies intermediate between residency and complete migration, are very strong motivations to evaluate migration occurrence and features in animal populations. The main goal of this paper was to perform a relative comparison between methods for identifying and characterizing migration at the individual and population level on the basis of animal location data. We classified 104 yearly individual trajectories from five populations of three deer species as migratory or non-migratory, by means of three methods: seasonal home range overlap, spatio-temporal separation of seasonal clusters and the Net Squared Displacement (NSD) method. For migratory cases, we also measured timing and distance of migration and residence time on the summer range. Finally, we compared the classification in migration cases across methods and populations. All methods consistently identified migration at the population level, that is, they coherently distinguished between complete or almost complete migratory populations and partially migratory populations. However, in the latter case, methods coherently classified only about 50{\%} of the single cases, that is they classified differently at the individual-animal level. We therefore infer that the comparison of methods may help point to 'less-stereotyped' cases in the residency-to-migration continuum. For cases consistently classified by all methods, no significant differences were found in migration distance, or residence time on summer ranges. Timing of migration estimated by NSD was earlier than by the other two methods, both for spring and autumn migrations. We suggest three steps to identify improper inferences from migration data and to enhance understanding of intermediate space-use strategies. We recommend (i) classifying migration behaviours using more than one method, (ii) performing sensitivity analysis on method parameters to identify the extent of the differences and (iii) investigating inconsistently classified cases as these may often be ecologically interesting (i.e. less-stereotyped migratory behaviours).},

abstract = {Freshwater biodiversity is the over-riding conservation priority during the International Decade for Action - 'Water for Life' - 2005 to 2015. Fresh water makes up only 0.01{\%} of the World's water and approximately 0.8{\%} of the Earth's surface, yet this tiny fraction of global water supports at least 100000 species out of approximately 1.8 million - almost 6{\%} of all described species. Inland waters and freshwater biodiversity constitute a valuable natural resource, in economic, cultural, aesthetic, scientific and educational terms. Their conservation and management are critical to the interests of all humans, nations and governments. Yet this precious heritage is in crisis. Fresh waters are experiencing declines in biodiversity far greater than those in the most affected terrestrial ecosystems, and if trends in human demands for water remain unaltered and species losses continue at current rates, the opportunity to conserve much of the remaining biodiversity in fresh water will vanish before the 'Water for Life' decade ends in 2015. Why is this so, and what is being done about it? This article explores the special features of freshwater habitats and the biodiversity they support that makes them especially vulnerable to human activities. We document threats to global freshwater biodiversity under five headings: overexploitation; water pollution; flow modification; destruction or degradation of habitat; and invasion by exotic species. Their combined and interacting influences have resulted in population declines and range reduction of freshwater biodiversity worldwide. Conservation of biodiversity is complicated by the landscape position of rivers and wetlands as 'receivers' of land-use effluents, and the problems posed by endemism and thus non-substitutability. In addition, in many parts of the world, fresh water is subject to severe competition among multiple human stakeholders. Protection of freshwater biodiversity is perhaps the ultimate conservation challenge because it is influenced by the upstream drainage network, the surrounding land, the riparian zone, and - in the case of migrating aquatic fauna - downstream reaches. Such prerequisites are hardly ever met. Immediate action is needed where opportunities exist to set aside intact lake and river ecosystems within large protected areas. For most of the global land surface, trade-offs between conservation of freshwater biodiversity and human use of ecosystem goods and services are necessary. We advocate continuing attempts to check species loss but, in many situations, urge adoption of a compromise position of management for biodiversity conservation, ecosystem functioning and resilience, and human livelihoods in order to provide a viable long-term basis for freshwater conservation. Recognition of this need will require adoption of a new paradigm for biodiversity protection and freshwater ecosystem management - one that has been appropriately termed 'reconciliation ecology'. {\textcopyright} 2005 Cambridge Philosophical Society.},

abstract = {Studies of infant feeding and weaning patterns in past populations that rely on a cross-sec- tional approach must make the assumption that no infant mortality bias exists. Previous investigations of infant weaning patterns at the Dakhleh Oasis, Egypt, relied on cross-sectional isotope data. In this study, we re-examine this weaning pattern, using a simulated lon- gitudinal approach, which does not require any assump- tions regarding potential infant mortality biases. This involves examining the dental isotopic signatures of indi- viduals who survived the weaning process. Stable isotope signatures from juveniles and adults (102 individuals, 297 teeth) were examined to reconstruct the weaning history of those that survived the weaning process. Both deciduous and permanent teeth were sampled. Homoge- nized enamel and dentin samples were isolated from each tooth and analyzed for d13Cap and d18Oap from the enamel and d15Ncoll and d13Ccoll from dentin collagen. We investigate differences between in utero versus postbirth, preweaning versus postweaning, and juvenile versus adult stable isotope values as reflected in the dentition. A random permutation procedure was used to test for statistically significant differences in stable isotope values between tooth types. Statistically significant dif- ferences were observed in all stable isotopes between permanent and deciduous teeth, and between early and later forming permanent teeth in d13Cap and d15Ncoll iso- topes. These results indicate dietary change between in utero and postbirth, and changes occurring during the weaning period. These results provide a more compre- hensive picture of infant weaning practices at Kellis and provide further support that complete weaning occurred by 3 years of age.},

abstract = {The abiotic environment has strong influences on the growth, survival, behavior, and ecology of aquatic organisms. Biotic interactions and species life histories interact with abiotic factors to structure the food web. One measure of food-web structure is food-chain length. Several hypotheses predict a linear relationship between one environmental variable (e.g., disturbance or ecosystem size) and food-chain length. However, many abiotic and biotic variables interact in diverse ways to structure a community, and may affect other measures of food web structure besides food-chain length. This study took a multivariate approach to test the influence of several important environmental variables on four food-web characteristics measured in nine ponds along a hydroperiod gradient over two years. This approach allowed for testing the ecosystem size and dynamic constraints hypotheses while in context of other possibly interacting environmental variables. The relationship between amphibian and invertebrate communities and pond habitat variables was assessed to understand the underlying food-web structure. Hydroperiod and pond area had a strong influence on amphibian and invertebrate communities, trophic diversity and $\delta${\textless}sup{\textgreater}15{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}N range. The range in $\delta${\textless}sup{\textgreater}13{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}C values responded strongly to dissolved oxygen. Food-chain length responded to multiple environmental variables. Invertebrate and amphibian communities were structured by pond hydroperiod which in turn influenced the trophic diversity of the food web. The results of this study suggest food-chain length is influenced by environmental variation and species assemblage and that a multivariate approach may allow us to better understand the dynamics within and across aquatic food webs.},

abstract = {Understanding the stability of ecological communities is a matter of
increasing importance in the context of global environmental change. Yet
it has proved to be a challenging task. Different metrics are used to
assess the stability of ecological systems, and the choice of one metric
over another may result in conflicting conclusions. Although each of the
multitude of metrics is useful for answering a specific question about
stability, the relationship among metrics is poorly understood. Such
lack of understanding prevents scientists from developing a unified
concept of stability. Instead, by investigating these relationships we
can unveil how many dimensions of stability there are (i.e., in how many
independent components stability metrics can be grouped), which should
help build a more comprehensive concept of stability. Here we
simultaneously measured 27 stability metrics frequently used in
ecological studies. Our approach is based on dynamical simulations of
multispecies trophic communities under different perturbation scenarios.
Mapping the relationships between the metrics revealed that they can be
lumped into 3 main groups of relatively independent stability
components: early response to pulse, sensitivities to press, and
distance to threshold. Selecting metrics from each of these groups
allows a more accurate and comprehensive quantification of the overall
stability of ecological communities. These results contribute to
improving our understanding and assessment of stability in ecological
communities.},

abstract = {Comparative observations in a captive setting of the sexual behavior of wild born and reared Pan troglodytes and Pan paniscus revealed important and unexpected behavioral differences between these two closely related species. The external genitalia of the female Pan paniscus is rotated anteriorly, copulation takes place throughout the cycle in Pan paniscus, and homosexual copulation is a common occurrence. Vocal and gestural exchanges often precede and accompany copulation in Pan paniscus but not in Pan troglodytes. Feeding and food sharing elicit copulatory activity on virtually every occasion in Pan paniscus, but not in Pan troglodytes. Copulatory positioning among Pan paniscus is marked by considerable variability, including en face ventro-ventral positioning. These observations suggest that, at least in aspects of sexual behavior, the pygmy chimpanzee displays greater malleability and greater dependencyupon complex non-verbal signaling. In Pan paniscus, copulatory behavior is more closely intertwined with other forms of social interaction such as food sharing. The sexual behavior patterns of the pygmy chimpanzee, while still quite distinct from those of man, nevertheless display a greater degree of similarity to the sexual patterns of our own species than do those of any other living non-human primate. {\textcopyright}1978 Academic Press Inc.

abstract = {1. New techniques for identifying the average taxonomic range of species assemblages were applied to an extensive dataset of bottom-dwelling fish in the coastal waters of NW Europe. These taxonomic distinctness indices provided much greater resolution than traditional diversity indices as they incorporated information on taxonomic relationships into an index which measures species dominance. Unlike standard measures of species richness and diversity, the mean value of these statistics is independent of sampling effort, and this allows objective comparisons to be made between samples from studies where sampling effort is not standardized. 2. A reduction in the average taxonomic range between the fauna of western waters of the UK and that of the southern North Sea was consistent with the general decline in species richness observed between these regions, and suggests that these two factors may be spatially positively correlated. Indices calculated for individual samples of fish on a local scale, however, did not all fit this trend. 3. Much of the variability in taxonomic diversity within the coastal waters of NW Europe was caused by the variable geographical distribution of the elasmobranchs. Of all the families which comprise the fish communities, this group has life-history characteristics which make it most susceptible to impact by commercial trawl fisheries. 4. The use of taxonomic distinctness measures provided additional insights, of relevance to biodiversity assessment, suggesting that they might usefully be applied to other aquatic and terrestrial fauna.},

Using field data that have been gathered since 1981, the distribution of these three species has been mapped. The resultant map reveals that no sympatry is known and that rivers form the interspecific boundaries. However, rivers apparently are not barriers to the dispersal of species in this group. Instead, distributions appear to be limited ecologically, by competitive exclusion. Historically, it appears that the ancestral stock initially dispersed throughout this area, then the P. melalophos stock split from the P. thomasi-P. femoralis stock, the P. thomasi stock split from the P. femoralis stock, and, finally, the P. femoralis stock dispersed to eastern Sumatera. It appears unlikely that the centrifugal speciation hypothesis based on the principle of metachromism applies to deployment of the P. melalophos group.},

abstract = {Species interactions are difficult to quantify, and, consequently, many studies have used species traits and phylogeny as proxies under an assumption of niche conservatism (i.e., closely related and morphologically similar species should have similar niches). However, few studies have investigated whether niches actually are conserved within and across diverse communities. Here, we tested the degree to which phylogenetic relatedness and morphological similarity predict diets and stable isotopic ratios ($\delta$15N and $\delta$13C), two common descriptors of the trophic niche, in fish assemblages of two small streams in the Neotropics. We also tested the strength of the association between isotopic ratios and diet composition and found significant correlations implying that isotopic signals reveal trophic structure despite error associated with estimates of trophic enrichment and variation associated with tissue preservation, metabolism, and other factors affecting isotopic ratios. Morphological traits yielded a significant phylogenetic signal, and both morphological traits and phylogeny were correlated with diet composition, with morphological traits being a stronger predictor. We infer that functionally relevant morphological traits of fish can be used to infer trophic niches for certain kinds of questions and analyses when trophic data are lacking. However, we highlight that using phylogenetic and morphological data in combination with dietary and/or isotopic data can improve resolution of assemblage trophic structure and niche diversification.},

abstract = {Biotic interactions are often ignored in assessments of climate change impacts. However, climate-related changes in species interactions, often mediated through increased dominance of certain species or functional groups, may have important implications for how species respond to climate warming and altered precipitation patterns. We examined how a dominant plant functional group affected the population dynamics of four co-occurring forb species by experimentally removing graminoids in seminatural grasslands. Specifically, we explored how the interaction between dominants and subordinates varied with climate by replicating the removal experiment across a climate grid consisting of 12 field sites spanning broad-scale temperature and precipitation gradients in southern Norway. Biotic interactions affected population growth rates of all study species, and the net outcome of interactions between dominants and subordinates switched from facilitation to competition with increasing temperature along the temperature gradient. The impacts of competitive interactions on subordinates in the warmer sites could primarily be attributed to reduced plant survival. Whereas the response to dominant removal varied with temperature, there was no overall effect of precipitation on the balance between competition and facilitation. Our findings suggest that global warming may increase the relative importance of competitive interactions in seminatural grasslands across a wide range of precipitation levels, thereby favouring highly competitive dominant species over subordinate species. As a result, seminatural grasslands may become increasingly dependent on disturbance (i.e. traditional management such as grazing and mowing) to maintain viable populations of subordinate species and thereby biodiversity under future climates. Our study highlights the importance of population-level studies replicated under different climatic conditions for understanding the underlying mechanisms of climate change impacts on plants.},

abstract = {Diel temperature oscillations are a nearly ubiquitous phenomenon, with amplitudes predicted to change along with mean temperatures under global-warming scenarios. Impact assessments of global warming have largely disregarded diel temperature oscillations, even though key processes in ecosystems, such as decomposition, may be affected. We tested the effect of a 5°C temperature increase with and without diel oscillations on litter decomposition by fungal communities in stream microcosms. Five temperature regimes with identical thermal sums (degree days) were applied: constant 3° and 8°C; diel temperature oscillations of 5°C around each mean; and oscillations of 9°C around 8°C Temperature oscillations around 8°C (warming scenario), but not 3°C (ambient scenario), accelerated decomposition by 18{\%} (5°C oscillations) and 31{\%} (9°C oscillations), respectively, compared to the constant temperature regime at 8°C Community structure was not affected by oscillating temperatures, although the rise in mean temperature from 3° to 8°C consistently shifted the relative abundance of species. A simple model using temperature-growth responses of the dominant fungal decomposers accurately described the experimentally observed pattern, indicating that the effect of temperature oscillations on decomposition in our warming scenario was caused by strong curvilinear responses of species to warming at low temperature, particularly of the species becoming most abundant at 8°C (Tetracladium marchalianum). These findings underscore the need to consider species-specific temperature characteristics in concert with changes in communities when assessing consequences of global warming on ecosystem processes. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

abstract = {Summary: Food webs represent the paths of material and energy flow through organisms in an ecosystem. Anuran larvae are important components of pond food webs: they are abundant, consume large quantities of food and serve as prey for many organisms. However, there are very basic uncertainties about the feeding ecology of anuran larvae; for instance, as to which trophic level they belong and whether species differ in resource use. Because anuran larvae have been employed in model systems in experimental ecology for decades, these uncertainties could lead to misinterpretation of published experiments, or inadequate designs of experiments directed at general, conceptual issues in ecology. Using 13C and 15N stable isotope and gut content analyses of free-ranging and enclosed tadpoles of four ranid species (Lithobates sylvaticus, L. pipiens, L. clamitans, L. catesbeianus) in the food webs of six wetlands, we tested the following null hypotheses: (i) that anuran larvae are strict primary consumers; (ii) that they are non-selective feeders and therefore exhibit little feeding niche differentiation; (iii) that they are opportunistic consumers and (iv) that their diet remains unchanged through ontogeny. All four species consumed and assimilated substantial amounts of animal food; bullfrog larvae, in particular, appear to be predatory. Significant feeding niche differentiation among species occurred with respect to the sources of carbon, consumption of animal matter and nutritional quality of food ingested. We further documented opportunistic feeding habits and ontogenetic shifts in diet. Collectively, these studies revealed complex trophic relationships that might require a reconsideration of the role of anuran larvae in pond food webs, as well as a reinterpretation of results of previous studies employing anuran larvae in model experimental systems. {\textcopyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

It is shown that the widely used minimum convex polygon has some undesirable characteristics as an estimator, and thus should be used with caution. A method based on convex hull peeling of the data to estimate convex density contours is studied as an alternative simple home-range size estimator. Monte Carlo simulations show that this estimator has very similar statistical properties if the point fixes are generated from a bivariate normal distribution, a uniform on a disc distribution, and two other distributions with intermediate tail behaviour. These standard distributions are used as a reference to define a sample size bias-corrected estimator of home-range size, and to provide an approximate method for calculating the precision of this estimator. The technique is applied to the estimation of the home-range sizes of deer.},

abstract = {The loss of a predator from an ecological community can cause large changes in community structure and ecosystem processes, or have very little consequence for the remaining species and ecosystem. Understanding when and why the loss of a predator causes large changes in community structure and ecosystem processes is critical for understanding the functional consequences of biodiversity loss. We used experimental microbial communities to investigate how the removal of a large generalist predator affected the extinction frequency, population abundance and total biomass of its prey. We removed this predator in the presence or absence of an alternative, more specialist, predator in order to determine whether the specialist predator affected the outcome of the initial species removal. Removal of the large generalist predator altered some species' populations but many were unaffected and no secondary extinctions were observed. The specialist predator, though rare, altered the response of the prey community to the removal of the large generalist predator. In the absence of the specialist predator, the effects of the removal were only measurable at the level of individual species. However, when the specialist predator was present, the removal of the large generalist predator affected the total biomass of prey species. The results demonstrate that the effect of species loss from high trophic levels may be very context-dependent, as rare species can have disproportionately large effects in food webs.},

abstract = {candidate models, data analysis, hypothesis testing, model selection, null hypotheses. Model selection based on information-theoretic methods (Burnham and Anderson 2002) has gained prevalence as a strategy for analyzing ecological data, especially among wildlife biologists (Stephens et al. 2005). Development of this alternative strategy has been refreshing because it has encouraged many of us to reexamine the analytical strategies we use and especially to evaluate models built explicitly on a biological foundation. However, some proponents now advocate model selection as the only reasonable strategy for a wide range of analyses. In particular, there is growing sentiment that strategies based on the framework of hypothesis testing are now systematically inferior or inappropriate. Because all analytical strategies have strengths and weaknesses, all can be misused. My goal is to suggest that analysts make an informed choice from all available strategies, employing each in contexts where they are most informative, as the most appropriate strategy will always depend on the specific analytical context. For example, authors of recent texts on distance sampling (Buckland et al. 2001, 2004), an estimation framework rooted firmly in model selection, and authors of a monograph written by acknowledged experts in model selection (Burnham et al. 1987), use hypothesis tests routinely when they are appropriate and informative. Application of a single analytical strategy in all circumstances is inappropriate. Failure to consider important parameters or to obtain sufficient data limits all analytical strategies, including model selection. If sample sizes are small and precision of estimates is low, the ability to distinguish among candidate models will be weak, analogous to having low statistical power for traditional hypothesis tests. Selecting a model solely because it satisfies a fixed criterion such as the lowest Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC) is potentially as nai¨ve an approach as rejecting a null hypothesis of zero effect on the basis of a P-value being marginally less than 0.05. In the absence of additional information such as estimated effect sizes, these approaches are too simplistic to be uniformly reliable as endpoints of an analysis. Model selection can be an elegant and effective strategy to distinguish among candidate models based on data. Reliance on a small, fixed set of candidate models, however, presents an additional potential liability for model selection. If the set of candidate models is incomplete, the resulting inferences will be unreliable (Burnham and Anderson 2002, Johnson and Amland 2004). Therefore, in cases where a strong set of candidate models is not or cannot be developed, model selection may be less effective and less informative than approaches based on hypothesis testing. Consequently, model selection requires more information about the system of interest because inferences are contingent on this set of candidate models. The process of developing candidate models is a strength of model selection when done well and a weakness when done poorly. Although I routinely use both approaches, colleagues and reviewers have suggested increasingly that I use model selection instead of hypothesis testing in contexts where I felt hypothesis testing was more appropriate. Similarly, I have observed authors using model selection when their analyses may have been better informed by hypothesis tests.},

Because top predators often exert strong influence on their prey populations their extinction can have far-reaching consequences for the structure and functioning of ecosystems. It has, for example, been observed that the local loss of a predator can trigger a cascade of secondary extinctions. However, the time lags involved in such secondary extinctions remain unexplored. Here we show that the loss of a top predator leads to a significantly earlier onset of secondary extinctions in model communities than does the loss of a species from other trophic levels. Moreover, in most cases time to secondary extinction increases with increasing species richness. If local secondary extinctions occur early they are less likely to be balanced by immigration of species from local communities nearby. The implications of these results for community persistence and conservation priorities are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {Realised niches describe the environmental and biotic conditions that a species occupies. Among marine zooplankton, species traits, including body size, dietary mode (herbivore, omnivore, or carnivore), and diapause strategy are expected to influence the realised niche of a species. To date, realised niches are known for only a small number of copepod species. Here we quantify the realised niches of 88 copepod species measured by the Continuous Plankton Recorder (CPR) in the North Atlantic and Southern Ocean using Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) modelling. We estimate the univariate mean niche, niche breadth of copepods for several important environmental variables, and assess the relative effects of several key zooplankton traits on the mean niche. Sea surface temperature (SST) contributed the most information to the description of niches on average across all species, with the rank importance of the remaining variables varying between regions. In the North Atlantic SST, depth, salinity and chlorophyll niches separated omnivores and herbivores from carnivores while in the Southern Ocean niche differences across dietary modes were found for chlorophyll and wind stress only. Diapausing copepods were found to occur in colder temperatures compared with non-diapausing taxa, likely because of their capacity for accumulating lipids. A strong negative body size−niche breadth relationship was found only for diapausing copepods, suggesting that larger multi-year generation species are more reliant on a specific temperature range to successfully reach diapause. Our analysis demonstrates strong connections between copepod traits and their realised niches in natural populations.},

abstract = {Lakes and ponds cover only about 4{\%} of the Earth's non-glaciated surface, yet they represent disproportionately large sources of methane and carbon dioxide. Indeed, very small ponds (for example, {\textless}0.001 km 2) may account for approximately 40{\%} of all CH 4 emissions from inland waters. Understanding how greenhouse gas emissions from aquatic ecosystems will respond to global warming is therefore vital for forecasting biosphere-carbon cycle feedbacks. Here, we present findings on the long-term effects of warming on the fluxes of GHGs and rates of ecosystem metabolism in experimental ponds. We show that shifts in CH 4 and CO2 fluxes, and rates of gross primary production and ecosystem respiration, observed in the first year became amplified over seven years of warming. The capacity to absorb CO2 was nearly halved after seven years of warmer conditions. The phenology of greenhouse gas fluxes was also altered, with CO2 drawdown and CH 4 emissions peaking one month earlier in the warmed treatments. These findings show that warming can fundamentally alter the carbon balance of small ponds over a number of years, reducing their capacity to sequester CO2 and increasing emissions of CH 4; such positive feedbacks could ultimately accelerate climate change.},

Home-range estimations have generally been disregarded as a means of quantifying habitat use and availability. Seasonal habitat use of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus)calculated from a home-range estimator using an adaptive kernel method was compared with relocation point data from Sand Lake National Wildlife Refuge, South Dakota from 1 January 1993 to 27 June 1994, to determine if an adaptive kernel home-range estimator approximates traditional methods of quantifying habitat use. No differences between proportional area of seasonal home-ranges and point data were detected (P{\textgreater}0{\textperiodcentered}05), indicating that habitat use calculated from an adaptive kernel home-range estimate was similar to habitat use calculated from relocation points. Potential benefits of home-range estimations include consideration of radio-telemetry error, biological independence of observations, and complete utilisation distributions. Given the success of home-range estimators at quantifying habitat use, a new alternative to habitat use analysis is offered. In situations where inherent telemetry error is unavoidable, using proportional area of home-range contours to define habitat use avoids the pitfalls associated with telemetry relocation point data.},

abstract = {An important question in the network representation of ecological systems is to determine how direct and indirect interactions between species determine the positional importance of species in the ecosystem. Here we present a quantitative analysis of the similarities and differences of six different topological centrality measures as indicators of keystone species in 17 food webs. These indicators account for local, global and "meso-scale" - intermediate between local and global - topological information about species in the food webs. Using factor analysis we shown that most of these centrality indices share a great deal of topological information, which range from 75{\%} to 96{\%}. A generalized keystone indicator is then proposed by considering the factor loadings of the six-centrality measures, which contains most of the information encoded by these indices. However, the individual ordering of species according to these criteria display significant differences in most food webs. We simulate the effects of species extinction by removing species ranked according to a local and a "meso-scale" centrality indicator. The differences observed on three network characteristics - size, average distance and clustering coefficient of the largest component - after the removal of the most central nodes indicate that the consideration of these indices have different impacts for the ranking of species with conservational biology purposes. The "meso-scale" indicator appears to play an important role in determining the relative importance of species in epidemic spread and parasitism rates. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We used 83 camera traps to sample a habituated community of western chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes verus) of known community and territory size in Ta{\"{i}} National Park, Ivory Coast, and estimated community size and density using spatially explicit capture-recapture models. We aimed to: (1) validate camera trapping as a means to collect capture-recapture data for chimpanzees; (2) validate SECR methods to estimate chimpanzee density from camera trap data; (3) compare the efficacy of targeting locations frequently visited by chimpanzees versus deploying cameras according to a systematic design; (4) evaluate the performance of SECR estimators with reduced sampling effort; and (5) identify sources of heterogeneity in detection probabilities. Ten months of camera trapping provided abundant capture-recapture data. All weaned individuals were detected, most of them multiple times, at both an array of targeted locations, and a systematic grid of cameras positioned randomly within the study area, though detection probabilities were higher at targeted locations. SECR abundance estimates were accurate and precise, and analyses of subsets of the data indicated that the majority of individuals in a community could be detected with as few as five traps deployed within their territory.

To this end, we develop a model to investigate the response of hybrid terrestrial communities to two types of HL: random and contiguous. Our model reveals changes in stability—temporal variability in population abundances—that are dependent on the spatial configuration of HL. Our findings highlight that habitat area determines the variability of populations via changes in the distribution of species interaction strengths. The divergent responses of communities to random and contiguous HL result from different constraints imposed on individuals' mobility, impacting diversity and network structure in the random case, and destabilising communities by increasing interaction strength in the contiguous case. Analysis of intermediate HL suggests a gradual transition between the two extreme cases.},

Here, we report experiments in three-tier food chains in experimental ponds, streams and bromeliads in Canada and Costa Rica in the presence or absence of fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus) and invertebrate (Hesperoperla pacifica and Mecistogaster modesta) predators. We monitored carbon dioxide fluxes along with prey and primary producer biomass. We found substantially reduced carbon dioxide emissions in the presence of predators in all systems, despite differences in predator type, hydrology, climatic region, ecological zone and level of in situ primary production. We also observed lower amounts of prey biomass and higher amounts of algal and detrital biomass in the presence of predators. We conclude that predators have the potential to markedly influence carbon dioxide dynamics in freshwater systems. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

We introduce an energetic criterion, called extinction threshold, for which a species goes secondarily extinct when a certain fraction of its incoming energy is lost. We study the robustness to random node loss of 10 food webs based on empirically-derived weightings. We use different extinction scenarios (random removal and from most- to least-connected species), and we simulate 105 replicates for each extinction threshold to account for stochasticity of extinction dynamics.We quantified robustness on the basis of how many additional species (i.e. secondary extinctions) were lost after the direct removal of species (i.e. primary extinctions). For all food webs, the expected robustness linearly decreases with extinction threshold, although a large variance in robustness is observed. The sensitivity of robustness to variations in extinction threshold increases with food web species richness and quantitative unweighted link density, while we observed a nonlinear relationship when the predictor is food web connectance and no relationship with the proportion of autotrophs. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Summary 1. A major paradigm shift is occurring in the approach of ecologists to statistical analysis. The use of the traditional approach of null-hypothesis testing has been questioned and an alternative, model selection by information–theoretic methods, has been strongly promoted and is now widely used. For certain types of analysis, information–theoretic approaches offer powerful and compelling advantages over null-hypothesis testing. 2. The benefits of information–theoretic methods are often framed as criticisms of null-hypothesis testing. We argue that many of these criticisms are neither irremediable nor always fair. Many are criticisms of the paradigm's application, rather than of its formulation. Information–theoretic methods are equally vulnerable to many such misuses. Care must be taken in the use of either approach but users of null-hypothesis tests, in particular, must greatly improve standards of reporting and interpretation. 3. Recent critiques have suggested that the distinction between experimental and observational studies defines the limits of the utility of null-hypothesis testing (with the paradigm being applicable to the former but not the latter). However, we believe that there are many situations in which observational data are collected that lend themselves to analysis under the null-hypothesis testing paradigm. We suggest that the applicability of the two analytical paradigms is more accurately defined by studies that assess univariate causality (when null-hypothesis testing is adequate) and those that assess multivariate patterns of causality (when information–theoretic methods are more suitable). 4. Synthesis and applications. Many ecologists are confused about the circumstances under which different inferential paradigms might apply. We address some of the major criticisms of the null-hypothesis testing paradigm, assess those criticisms in relation to the information–theoretic paradigm, propose methods for improving the use of null-hypothesis testing, and discuss situations in which the use of null-hypothesis testing would be appropriate. We urge instructors and practitioners of statistical methods to heighten awareness of the limitations of null-hypothesis testing and to use information–theoretic methods whenever prior evidence suggests that multiple research hypotheses are plausible. We contend, however, that by marginalizing the use of null-hypothesis testing, ecologists risk rejecting a powerful, informative and well-established analytical tool.},

Weighted networks are an important tool for studying changes in interspecific interactions because they record interaction frequencies in addition to presence or absence at a field site. Here we show that changes in weighted network structure following habitat modification are, in principle, predictable. Our approach combines field data with mathematical models: The models separate changes in relative species abundance from changes in interaction preferences (which describe how interaction frequencies deviate from random encounters). The models with the best predictive ability compared to data requirement are those that capture systematic changes in interaction preferences between different habitat types. Our results suggest a viable approach for predicting the consequences of rapid environmental change for the structure of complex ecological networks, even in the absence of detailed, system-specific empirical data.},

More scientists are calling for a connection between medical and field research due to recent disease outbreaks in great apes, including Ebola, and indications of cross-transmission of Ebola and other viruses between primates and humans. A major limitation to progress is the lack of information on infectious diseases and their transmission in wild primates. Here, we present examples of successful pathogen detection in wild great apes and describe approaches and techniques that can be used in the field, focusing in particular on investigation of deaths and non-invasive sample collection. This interdisciplinary approach is providing new insights to infectious diseases of great apes and is helping to protect the health of great ape populations. This framework can also be applied to other mammals under threat from infectious diseases, including African wild dogs, seals and Tasmanian devils. In addition to providing benefits for great ape conservation, research that integrates infectious disease with primate ecology provides insights to emerging diseases in humans and the role of disease in primate evolution. {\textcopyright}2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Since the past century, rising CO2levels have led to global changes (ocean warming and acidification) with subsequent effects on marine ecosystems and organisms. Macroalgae-herbivore interactions have a main role in the regulation of marine community structure (top-down control). Gradients of warming prompt complex non-linear effects on organism metabolism, cascading into altered trophic interactions and community dynamics. However, not much is known on how will acidification and grazer assemblage composition shape these effects. Within this context, we aimed to assess the combined effects of warming gradients and acidification on macroalgae-herbivore interactions, using three cosmopolitan species, abundant in the Iberian Peninsula and closely associated in nature: the amphipod Melita palmata, the gastropod Gibbula umbilicalis, and the green macroalga Ulva rigida. Under two CO2treatments ($\Delta$CO2≃ 450 $\mu$atm) across a temperature gradient (13.5, 16.6, 19.9 and 22.1 °C), two mesocosm experiments were performed to assess grazer consumption rates and macroalgae-herbivore interaction, respectively. Warming (Experiment I and II) and acidification (Experiment II) prompted negative effects in grazer's survival and species-specific differences in consumption rates. M. palmata was shown to be the stronger grazer per biomass (but not per capita), and also the most affected by climate stressors. Macroalgae-herbivore interaction strength was markedly shaped by the temperature gradient, while simultaneous acidification lowered thermal optimal threshold. In the near future, warming and acidification are likely to strengthen top-down control, but further increases in disturbances may lead to bottom-up regulated communities. Finally, our results suggest that grazer assemblage composition may modulate future macroalgae-herbivore interactions.},

abstract = {Introduction Ecosystems change in time following dynamics that scholars have characterized as a true developmental process (Ulanowicz, 1986). Seen through the lenses of ecological community these changes are known as an overall progression called succession (McMahon, 1980). During this process species in an environment are gradually substituted by other, more adapted, associations until a final arrangement called climax emerges, with a well-established community (Clements, 1936; Whittaker, 1953; Odum, 1969). Although individual successional processes appear to be unique and dependent on timing, initial conditions, types of disturbance, and other factors (Sousa, 1984), if the development is orderly and directional it descends that some predictive capability can be achieved from its analysis (Noble and Slatyer, 1977). According to this, similarities and differences in processes and patterns have been investigated to extract generalizations that could help in shaping a general model for ecological succession (for a review of the various findings see Drury and Nisbet, 1973). Prominent among the many attempts to single out those changes is the summary proposed by Odum (1969). He predicted patterns for 24 features grouped in six main categories such as community energetic, life history, nutrient cycling, overall homeostasis, selection pressure, and community structure. This scheme has been extremely influential on ecological thought but it has also been criticized (Drury and Nisbet, 1973; Oksanen, 1991). The ideas that pervade the entire construction, such as balance, homeostasis, stability, and equilibrium, were challenged by a viewpoint that stresses disturbance, chance, and non-equilibrium as important drivers of ecosystem dynamics (Archer and Stokes, 2000). If succession would take place along defined pathways, then it should be possible to mark their progress in quantitative fashion. Schindler (1990) tested Odum's hypotheses by experimentally analyzing the effects of nutrient enrichment and acidification on whole-lake ecosystems. He found that acidified lakes showed progressively increasing P/R ratio, dominance of r-strategists among zooplankton, food-chain shortening, and decreased species diversity; this evidence confirmed that ecosystems under stress may show reversal trends with respect to Odum's (1985) scenario.},

This review examines the potential role of the emerging synthetic discipline of evolutionary community ecology in improving our understanding of how climate change will alter future distribution of biodiversity. We review theoretical and empirical advances about the role of niche evolution, interspecific interactions, and their interplay in altering species geographic ranges and community assembly.

abstract = {In the tropics and sub-tropics, estuarine environments with mangrove and seagrass habitats provide important structures and resources for diverse communities of benthic organisms. However, temperate estuarine habitats, especially in mangrove areas, may differ significantly in their community associations and interactions. The community composition of benthic macro-fauna was investigated within temperate Matapouri Estuary, northern New Zealand. The density and distribution of fauna were sampled within six distinctive habitats (mangrove stands, pneumatophore zones, Zostera beds, channels, banks, and sand flats), within four sampling events between December 2002 and September 2003. Each type of habitat was replicated seven times within different locations in the estuary. Counts of all infauna and epifauna within four replicate cores were recorded from each habitat and location. Multidimensional scaling plots were used to identify differences in structure and composition of assemblages among habitats and locations within each sampling event. Results from these benthic samples indicate that Matapouri Estuary has a high overall biodiversity, with distinctive faunal assemblages found within different habitats, and some seasonal variations also apparent. In terms of both number of individuals and taxa per unit area, seagrass beds had the highest numbers and mangrove areas had the lowest numbers, with all other habitats in between. Some locations were found to support a high diversity of organisms across habitats, while other locations had high densities of a few species only. Several physical and biological differences between tropical/sub-tropical and New Zealand's temperate mangrove habitats are put forth as potential reasons for the lower density and diversity of the benthic component observed herein. Further ongoing studies aim to elucidate the structure and interactions within food webs in this estuarine ecosystem. {\textcopyright}2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A food web can be seen as a collection of pathways distributing energy to the ecological community. Because of thermodynamical as well as ecological constraints, some pathways are more important than others, as they carry a much larger share of the energy flow. Such pathways, composed of 'strong' links, might be hidden in the tangled network of trophic interactions. Due to thermodynamic efficiency, leading to considerable loss at every passage, we expect these important pathways to be short - i.e. of minimal length. Minimum length spanning trees, which are trees formed by the minimum number of links to keep food webs connected, have been indicated as main energy routes. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed 30 well-resolved, weighted empirical food webs. From each food web, we extracted the minimum length spanning tree (MLST), and compared it to the maximum weight spanning tree (MWST) - a tree composed of connections of maximum strength. To have a robust comparison, we also computed the minimum weight spanning tree (MinWST), composed of the links of minimal strength. Finally, we extracted from each web 1000 random weighted spanning trees (RWSTs) to serve as a null model. We contrasted the different tree structures, and found that MWSTs are significantly shorter than random trees and MinWSTs, but always longer than MLSTs. In addition, MinWSTs are significantly longer than what expected from random trees. Our results show that in food webs, the bulk of energy travels along pathways that tend to be short, although they never coincide with the minimum length spanning trees.},

Experiments provide qualitative support for the instability of longer food chains , but, according to theory, this relationship may depend on the assump-tions used to model food chains. Here we show that experimental manipulations of productivity determine the length of microbial food chains in laboratory microcosms. Food-chain length is also predicted to determine how productivity influences population densities within trophic levels. If trophic levels consist entirely of edible prey, and if consumers feed only on the next-lower trophic level , population densities should alternate between increasing and constant values as food-chain length increases (Fig. 1). We find that food-chain length determines population-level responses to productivity, which is consistent with predictions from models. These results indicate that the impacts of human alterations of productivity will depend crucially on the structure of the affected food chains.},

abstract = {The focus on climate change adaptation, rather than mitigation, has become more prominent since the turn of the century. Given this, it is important to consider what has been achieved so far, particularly community-based approaches which have become the resolve for practitioners and donor agencies working in the sector. This review of 128 publications on community-based climate change adaptation, identified through a systematic database search, follows the development of this body of work in the academic literature. Commencing in the early 2000s, the literature detailed the emergence of community-based adaptation (CBA), driven by a number of factors: recognition of the human dimensions of changes; appreciation of the role of local knowledge for strengthening adaptive capacity; and a push to focus on the scale at which impacts are felt and link this action with pro-poor development outcomes. A more substantial body of work emerged in the literature from 2010 onwards, defining a series of key enablers for effective CBA, which included: use participatory approaches; recognise that adaptation is a social process; and support CBA at multiple scales. More recently, there has been a growing emphasis in the literature to re-conceptualise CBA, which will require focusing on innovation, learning and multi-sectoral approaches.},

The details of this method are described, using as an example a group of bees. The resulting classification was similar to that previously established by classical systematic methods, although some taxonomic changes were made in view of the new light thrown on relationships. The method is time consuming, although practical in isolated cases, with punched-card machines such as were used; it becomes generally practical with increasingly widely available digital computers.},

abstract = {Biogeography has traditionally focused on the spatial distribution and abundance of species. Both are driven by the way species interact with one another, but only recently community ecologists realized the need to document their spatial and temporal variation. Here, we call for an integrated approach, adopting the view that community structure is best represented as a network of ecological interactions, and show how it translates to biogeography questions. We propose that the ecological niche should encompass the effect of the environment on species distribution (the Grinnellian dimension of the niche) and on the ecological interactions among them (the Eltonian dimension). Starting from this concept, we develop a quantitative theory to explain turnover of interactions in space and time – i.e. a novel approach to interaction distribution modeling. We apply this framework to host–parasite interactions across Europe and find that two aspects of the environment (temperature and precipitation) exert a strong imprint on species co-occurrence, but not on species interactions. Even where species co-occur, interaction proves to be stochastic rather than deterministic, adding to variation in realized network structure. We also find that a large majority of host-parasite pairs are never found together, thus precluding any inferences regarding their probability to interact. This first attempt to explain variation of network structure at large spatial scales opens new perspectives at the interface of species distribution modeling and community ecology.},

abstract = {We outline a general method to carry out population viability analyses (PVA) by making we of matrix population models. We consider a structured population (by age, sex, reproductive status space, etc.) whose demographic parameters are known from field study. To assess the extinction risk and definite a management program, we advocate a three-step PVA: (1) Setting up a constant matrix model that includes the mean values of demographic rates. The sizes of each population class are linked from one year to the next by a transition matrix that contains all vital rates. When these parameters are taken to be constant (fixed to their mean), the matrix analysis yields the determine population growth rate, population structure, stage-specific reproductive values and the sensitivities of the growth rate to variations in demographic rate. (2) Assessing the extinction risk due to stochastic factors: demographic stochasticity, environmental stochasticity and catastrophes. We show how to compute the stochastic growth rate, extinction probabilities and the distribution of time to extinction, from computations based on the constant matrix model (step 1) together with Monte-Carlo simulations. (3) Determining action on demographic parameters and amelioration of monitoring programs. The extinction risk can be reduced by increasing the population growth rate, decreasing its temporal variability or boosting current population size. Which parameters should be fine-tuned in order to cause the largest increase in population growth can be found out by computing the growth rate elasticities to demographic rates. Furthermore, variance in population growth can be decomposed into the produced by mean parameter values, and that produced by fluctuations in parameters. Finally, reproductive values and their sensitivities indicate which classes should be reinforced to obtain a long-lasting raise of population size. The ULM software allows one to apply this agenda automatically to any particular case study. The software can be conveniently used to model populations with an kind of life cycle. The user will enter the model by making use of a friendly, simplified programming language that leaves him or her entirely free to decide of the matrix structure, parameter values and factors of parameter variations (stochastic factors, density-dependence...). All PVA-related parameters mentioned above (growth rate, sensitivities, elasticities, extinction probabilities, distribution of extinction time, etc.) are computed by the software. Here this is illustrated with an overview of two case studies, that of a natural, declining population of snakes (Vipera ursinii ursinii) and that of a reintroduced, growing population of raptors (Gyps fulvus fulvus).},

abstract = {1. Climate-change effects on rivers and streams might interact with other pressures, such as pollution, but long-term investigations are scarce. We assessed trends among macroinvertebrates in 50 southern English streams in relation to temperature, discharge and water quality over 18 years (1989-2007). 2. Long-term records, coupled with estimates from inter-site calibrations of 3-4 years, showed that mean stream temperatures in the study area had increased by 2.1-2.9 °C in winter and 1.1-1.5 °C in summer over the 26 year period from 1980 to 2006, with trends in winter strongest. 3. While invertebrate assemblages in surface-fed streams were constant, those in chalk-streams changed significantly during 1989-2007. Invertebrate trends correlated significantly with temperature, but effects were spurious because (i) assemblages gained taxa typical of faster flow or well-oxygenated conditions, contrary to expectations from warming; (ii) more invertebrate families increased in abundance than declined and (iii) concomitant changes in water quality (e.g. declining orthophosphate, ammonia and biochemical oxygen demand), or at some sites changes in discharge, explained more variation in invertebrate abundance and composition than did temperature. 4. These patterns were reconfirmed in both group- and site-specific analyses. 5. We conclude that recent winter-biased warming in southern English chalk-streams has been insufficient to affect invertebrates negatively over a period of improving water quality. This implies that positive management can minimize some climate-change impacts on stream ecosystems. Chalk-stream invertebrates are sensitive, nevertheless, to variations in discharge, and detectable changes could occur if climate change alters flow pattern. 6. Because climatic trends now characterize many inter-annual time-series, we caution other investigators to examine whether putative effects on ecological systems are real or linked spuriously to other causes of change. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

abstract = {Environment and genetics combine to influence tree growth and should therefore be jointly considered when evaluating forest responses in a warming climate. Here, we combine dendroclimatology and population genetic approaches with the aim of attributing climatic influences on growth of European larch (Larix decidua) and Norway spruce (Picea abies). Increment cores and genomic DNA samples were collected from populations along a {\~{}}900-m elevational transect where the air temperature gradient encompasses a {\~{}}4 °C temperature difference. We found that low genetic differentiation among populations indicates gene flow is high, suggesting that migration rate is high enough to counteract the selective pressures of local environmental variation. We observed lower growth rates towards higher elevations and a transition from negative to positive correlations with growing season temperature upward along the elevational transect. With increasing elevation there was also a clear increase in the explained variance of growth due to summer temperatures. Comparisons between climate sensitivity patterns observed along this elevational transect with those from Larix and Picea sites distributed across the Alps reveal good agreement, and suggest that tree-ring width (TRW) variations are more climate-driven than genetics-driven at regional and larger scales. We conclude that elevational transects are an extremely valuable platform for understanding climatic-driven changes over time and can be especially powerful when working within an assessed genetic framework. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Descriptions of habitat temperatures and predicted changes in climate usually consider mean monthly, seasonal or annual conditions. Ectotherms, however, do not simply experience mean conditions, but are exposed to daily fluctuations in habitat temperatures. Here, we highlight how temperature fluctuation can generate 'realized' thermal reaction (fitness) norms that differ from the 'fundamental' norms derived under standard constant temperatures. Using a mosquito as a model organism, we find that temperature fluctuation reduces rate processes such as development under warm conditions, increases processes under cool conditions, and reduces both the optimum and the critical maximum temperature. Generalizing these effects for a range of terrestrial insects reveals that prevailing daily fluctuations in temperature should alter the sensitivity of species to climate warming by reducing 'thermal safety margins'. Such effects of daily temperature dynamics have generally been ignored in the climate change literature. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Organism size is one of the key determinants of community structure, and its relationship with abundance can describe how biomass is partitioned among the biota within an ecosystem. An outdoor freshwater mesocosm experiment was used to determine how warming of{\~{}}4°C would affect the size, biomass and taxonomic structure of planktonic communities. Warming increased the steepness of the community size spectrum by increasing the prevalence of small organisms, primarily within the phytoplankton assemblage and it also reduced the mean and maximum size of phytoplankton by approximately one order of magnitude. The observed shifts in phytoplankton size structure were reflected in changes in phytoplankton community composition, though zooplankton taxonomic composition was unaffected by warming. Furthermore, warming reduced community biomass and total phytoplankton biomass, although zooplankton biomass was unaffected. This resulted in an increase in the zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio in the warmed mesocosms, which could be explained by faster turnover within the phytoplankton assemblages. Overall, warming shifted the distribution of phytoplankton size towards smaller individuals with rapid turnover and low standing biomass, resulting in a reorganization of the biomass structure of the food webs. These results indicate future environmental warming may have profound effects on the structure and functioning of aquatic communities and ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

Despite the duration, the effects of a short visit by a top predator may remain long after departure. To test hypotheses on the impacts of a short-term visit by a top predator on pond communities, we used artificial ponds and constructed food web treatments that varied in trophic structure (Control Food Web = no predators present, Bluegill Food Web = only intermediate predators present, and Full Food Web = top and intermediate predators present). The constructed food webs were replicated five times and contained two prey species (frog tadpoles), an intermediate predator (fish), and one top predator (freshwater turtle). The Full Food Web simulated a four-day visit by Chelydra serpentina (Common Snapping Turtle). Predation by Lepomis macrochirus (Bluegill) reduced mean tadpole survival for Hyla chrysoscelis (Cope's Gray Tree Frog) in all food webs, including the Full Food Web with C. serpentina, compared to the Control Food Web. Although C. serpentina had no effects on tadpoles of H. chrysoscelis, the top predator reduced mean survival and increased mean mass of Rana sphenocephala (Southern Leopard Frog) when compared to the Bluegill Food Web. Therefore, our results suggest that brief visits from transient organisms, especially top predators, can alter community structure and initiate cascading effects.},

In recent decades, ecologists developed many measures and indices in order to quantify a larger proportion of information about communities or species assemblages.

Among the most common diversity metrics are the indices of taxonomic diversity, functional diversity and phylogenetic diversity. These metrics are often used to assess effectiveness of conservation planning. One concern on the use of many diversity metrics, especially in modeling, is the potential redundancy among these indices and measures. Many scientists explored the associations among different diversity metrics, finding clear patterns. For instance, functional richness and the functional diversity (FD) index are both positively correlated with species richness, while functional evenness should be unrelated to species richness. Furthermore, explorations focusing on associations between phylogenetic diversity and taxonomic or functional diversity metrics are few. However, despite the importance of the types of environment has on biotic assemblage rules, there are no studies comparing the association among diversity metrics across different type of environments. Here, we found higher values of taxonomic diversity, functional richness and Rao's quadratic entropy (RaoQ) in farmland than in forests and grasslands. Forest bird communities were characterized by a large amount of evolutionary history as reflected by community evolutionary distinctiveness (CED). Furthermore, associations among diversity and community metrics in bird communities differ across types of environments. Within functional diversity metrics, associations between functional richness and RaoQ as well as associations between functional evenness and divergence were always positive, independently of the type of environment. The associations between functional richness and evenness or divergence, as well as functional evenness and RaoQ, changed strength and direction of correlation between different types of environment. In conclusion, a) large scale conservation planning strategies have to consider that different environments support different dimensions of bird diversity, and b) when modeling many diversity metrics, associations among diversity and community metrics can also change across environments.},

abstract = {Metabolism provides a basis for using first principles of physics, chemistry, and biology to link the biology of individual organisms to the ecology of populations, communities, and ecosystems. Metabolic rate, the rate at which organisms take up, transform, and expend energy and materials, is the most fundamental biological rate. We have developed a quantitative theory for how metabolic rate varies with body size and temperature. Metabolic theory predicts how metabolic rate, by setting the rates of resource uptake from the environment and resource allocation to survival, growth, and reproduction, controls ecological processes at all levels of organization from individuals to the biosphere. Examples include: (1) life history attributes, including development rate, mortality rate, age at maturity, life span, and population growth rate; (2) population interactions, including carrying capacity, rates of competition and predation, and patterns of species diversity; and (3) ecosystem processes, including rates of biomass production and respiration and patterns of trophic dynamics. Data compiled from the ecological literature strongly support the theoretical predictions. Eventually, metabolic theory may provide a conceptual foundation for much of ecology, just as genetic theory provides a foundation for much of evolutionary biology.},

Phytoplankton biomass started increasing over the water column in February-early March, and generally achieved peak values in the upper layers in late spring. Another peak was often recorded in autumn. Diatoms and phytoflagellates dominated for the largest part of the year. Ciliates showed their main peaks in phase with phyloplankton and were mainly represented by small ({\textless} 30 $\mu$m) naked choreotrichs. Mesozooplankton increased in March-April, reaching maximum concentrations in summer. Copepods were always the most abundant group, followed by cladocerans in summer. At the interannual scale, a high variability and a decreasing trend were recorded over the sampling period for autotrophic biomass. Mesozooplankton biomass showed a less marked interannual variability. From 1995 onwards, phytoplankton populations increased in cell number but decreased in cell size, with intense blooms of small diatoms and undetermined coccoid species frequently observed in recent years. In spite of those interannual variations, the different phases of the annual cycle and the occurrence of several plankton species were remarkably regular.},

abstract = {Inverse trophic cascades are a well explored and common consequence of the local depletion or extinction of top predators in natural ecosystems. Despite a large body of research, the cascading effects of predator removal on ecosystem functions are not as well understood. Developing microcosm experiments, we explored food web changes in trophic structure and ecosystem functioning following biomass removal of top predators in representative temperate and tropical rock pool communities that contained similar assemblages of zooplankton and benthic invertebrates. We observed changes in species abundances following predator removal in both temperate and tropical communities, in line with expected inverse effects of a trophic cascade, where predation release benefits the predator's preys and competitors and impacts the preys of the latter. We also observed several changes at the community and ecosystem levels including a decrease in total abundance and mean trophic level of the community, and changes in chlorophyll-a and total dissolved particles. Our results also showed an increase in variability of both community and ecosystem processes following the removal of predators. These results illustrate how predator removal can lead to inverse trophic cascades both in structural and functioning properties, and can increase variability of ecosystem processes. Although observed patterns were consistent between tropical and temperate communities following an inverse cascade pattern, changes were more pronounced in the temperate community. Therefore, aquatic food webs may have inherent traits that condition ecosystem responses to changes in top-down trophic control and render some aquatic ecosystems especially sensitive to the removals of top predators. {\textcopyright} 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

These algorithms arc conceptually and computationally simple, and learn a different set of feature weights for each identilied cluster. The cluster dependent feature weights offer two advantages. First, they guide the clustering process to partition the data into more meaningful clusters. Second, they can be used in the subsequent steps of a learning system to improve its learning behavior. An extension of the algorithm to deal with an unknown number of clusters is also presented. The extension is based on competitive agglomeration, whereby the number of clusters is over-specified, and adjacent clusters are allowed to compete for data points in a manner that causes clusters which lose in the competition to gradually become depicted and vanish. We illustrate the performance of the proposed approach by using it to segment color images, categorize text document collections, and build a multi-modal thesaurus and use it to annotate image regions. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

To empirically measure the short-term effects of removing large animals from an ocean ecosystem, we used exclosures to remove large fish from a near-pristine coral reef at Palmyra Atoll, Central Pacific Ocean. We identified a range of effects that followed from the removal of these large fish. These effects were revealed within weeks of their removal. Removing large fish (1) altered the behavior of prey fish; (2) reduced rates of herbivory on certain species of reef algae; (3) had both direct positive (reduced mortality of coral recruits) and indirect negative (through reduced grazing pressure on competitive algae) impacts on recruiting corals; and (4) tended to decrease abundances of small mobile benthic invertebrates. Results of this kind help advance our understanding of the ecological importance of large animals in ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author(s).},

Ecologists have investigated both the influence of environmental variables on species diversity and the influence of species diversity on ecosystem function and stability. These investigations have largely been carried out without taking into account the overarching stabilizing structures of food webs that arise from evolutionary and successional processes and that are maintained through species interactions. Here, we argue that the same large-scale structures that have been purported to convey stability to food webs can also help to understand both the distribution of species diversity in nature and the relationship between species diversity and food web stability. Specifically, the allocation of species diversity to slow energy channels within food webs results in the skewed distribution of interactions strengths that has been shown to confer stability to complex food webs. We end by discussing the processes that might generate and maintain the structured, stable and diverse food webs observed in nature. {\textcopyright} 2011.},

abstract = {1. Recent efforts to understand how the patterning of interaction strength affects both structure and dynamics in food webs have highlighted several obstacles to productive synthesis. Issues arise with respect to goals and driving questions, methods and approaches, and placing results in the context of broader ecological theory. 2. Much confusion stems from lack of clarity about whether the questions posed relate to community-level patterns or to species dynamics, and to what authors actually mean by the term 'interaction strength'. Here, we describe the various ways in which this term has been applied and discuss the implications of loose terminology and definition for the development of this field. 3. Of particular concern is the clear gap between theoretical and empirical investigations of interaction strengths and food web dynamics. The ecological community urgently needs to explore new ways to estimate biologically reasonable model coefficients from empirical data, such as foraging rates, body size, metabolic rate, biomass distribution and other species traits. 4. Combining numerical and analytical modelling approaches should allow exploration of the conditions under which different interaction strengths metrics are interchangeable with regard to relative magnitude, system responses, and species identity. 5. Finally, the prime focus on predator-prey links in much of the research to date on interaction strengths in food webs has meant that the potential significance of nontrophic interactions, such as competition, facilitation and biotic disturbance, has been largely ignored by the food web community. Such interactions may be important dynamically and should be routinely included in future food web research programmes.},

By means of different methods (i.e., average taxo-nomic distinctness index, conventional diversity measures, and non-parametric multivariate analysis), changes in benthic commun-ity structure were investigated. In the 13-year period, the southern area of the lagoon underwent a marinization process. A quite strong environmental gradient along its main N-S axis was then found. Multivariate analysis was the most powerful tool for the assessment of benthic community changes, revealing community patterns that univariate measures of diversity were unable to de-tect. Relevant information on the taxonomic structure of the com-munity was given by the distinctness index, but this did not prove sensitive to environmental changes, probably due to the charac-teristics of the studied environment.},

However, it is unknown whether and how warming alters the importance of topdown vs. bottom-up control over community productivity and variability. We performed a 16- month factorial experimental manipulation of warming, nutrient enrichment, and predator presence in replicated freshwater pond mesocosms to test their independent and interactive impacts. Warming strengthened trophic cascades from fish to primary producers, and it decreased the impact of eutrophication on the mean and temporal variation of phytoplankton biomass. These impacts varied seasonally, with higher temperatures leading to stronger trophic cascades in winter and weaker algae blooms under eutrophication in summer. Our results suggest that higher temperatures may shift the control of primary production in freshwater ponds toward stronger top-down and weaker bottom-up effects. The dampened temporal variability of algal biomass under eutrophication at higher temperatures suggests that warming may stabilize some ecosystem processes. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

In this paper, I discuss the role of network analysis (and centrality indices in particular) in this process and present a new and simple approach to characterizing the interaction structures of each species in a complex network. Understanding the linkage between structure and dynamics is a condition to test the results of topological studies, I briefly overview our current knowledge on this issue. The study of key nodes in networks has become an increasingly general interest in several disciplines: I will discuss some parallels. Finally, I will argue that conservation biology needs to devote more attention to identify and conserve keystone species and relatively less attention to rarity. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Seagrass beds provide food and shelter for many fish species. However, the manner in which fishes use seagrass bed habitats often varies with life stage. Juvenile fishes can be especially dependent on seagrass beds because seagrass and associated habitats (drift macroalgae) may provide an effective tradeoff between shelter from predation and availability of prey. This study addressed aspects of habitat use by post-settlement pinfish, Lagodon rhomboides (Linneaus), an abundant and trophically important species in seagrass beds in the western North Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. Abundance of post-settlement fish in seagrass beds was positively related to volume of drift macroalgae, but not to percent cover of seagrass, indicating a possible shelter advantage of the spatially complex algae. Tethering experiments indicated higher rates of predation in seagrass without drift macroalgae than in seagrass with drift macroalgae. Aquarium experiments showed lower predation with higher habitat complexity, but differences were only significant for the most extreme cases (unvegetated bottom, highest macrophyte cover). Levels of dissolved oxygen did not differ between vegetated and unvegetated habitats, indicating no physiological advantage for any habitat. Seagrass beds with drift macroalgae provide the most advantageous tradeoff between foraging and protection from predation for post-settlement L. rhomboides. The complex three-dimensional shelter of drift macroalgae provides an effective shelter that is embedded in the foraging habitat provided by seagrass. Drift macroalgae in seagrass beds is a beneficial habitat for post-settlement L. rhomboides by reducing the risk of predation, and by providing post-settlement habitat within the mosaic (seagrass beds) of adult habitat, thus reducing risks associated with ontogenetic habitat shifts. {\textcopyright}2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Sympatric species with similar ecological requirements and differences in body size would be expected to partition resources to facilitate coexistence. For sexually dimorphic species, we may expect resource partitioning by gender as well as by species identity. However, it is difficult to document species and sexual resource partitioning in marine ecosystems, given the intractability of these systems and the vagility of many marine animals. Here, we examined differences in the foraging behavior and prey selection of 2 congeneric and coexisting seabird species-masked boobies Sula dactylatra and red-footed boobies Sula sula-on Palmyra Atoll in the equatorial Pacific Ocean. These seabirds exhibit substantial size dimorphism between species and also have reverse sexual dimorphism within species. Pronounced interspecific differences in foraging patterns were observed with high-resolution GPS tracking devices, where smaller red-footed boobies conducted longer foraging trips (in both time and distance). Red-footed boobies also had more frequent landings on the sea surface, slower mean and maximum travel speeds, and more westerly trip azimuths. Stable isotope and diet analyses produced data that complemented returns from electronic tagging. Stable isotope ratios of carbon indicated that masked boobies foraged on prey with a less pelagic {\"{a}}13C signature compared to red-footed boobies. In contrast, no gender differences were identified in any foraging parameters. The mechanisms for maintenance of these pronounced differences in niche partitioning across species were not explicitly examined, yet the data suggest physiological variation across species may be a more plausible mechanism than competitive interactions. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2010.},

Other such types include habitat modification, predator interference and facilitation. However, ecological network research has been typically limited to either pure food webs or to networks of only a few ({\textless}3) interaction types. The great diversity of non-trophic interactions observed in nature has been poorly addressed by ecologists and largely excluded from network theory. Herein, we propose a conceptual framework that organises this diversity into three main functional classes defined by how they modify specific parameters in a dynamic food web model. This approach provides a path forward for incorporating non-trophic interactions in traditional food web models and offers a new perspective on tackling ecological complexity that should stimulate both theoretical and empirical approaches to understanding the patterns and dynamics of diverse species interactions in nature. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {A long-standing question in community ecology is whether food webs are organized in compartments, where species within the same compartment interact frequently among themselves, but show fewer interactions with species from other compartments. Finding evidence for this community organization is important since compartmentalization may strongly affect food web robustness to perturbation. However, few studies have found unequivocal evidence of compartments, and none has quantified the suite of mechanisms generating such a structure. Here, we combine computational tools from the physics of complex networks with phylogenetic statistical methods to show that a large marine food web is organized in compartments, and that body size, phylogeny, and spatial structure are jointly associated with such a compartmentalized structure. Sharks account for the majority of predatory interactions within their compartments. Phylogenetically closely related shark species tend to occupy different compartments and have divergent trophic levels, suggesting that competition may play an important role structuring some of these compartments. Current overfishing of sharks has the potential to change the structural properties, which might eventually affect the stability of the food web. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {A rich body of empirically grounded theory has developed about food webs - the networks of feeding relationships among species within habitats. However, detailed food-web data and analyses are lacking for ancient ecosystems, largely because of the low resolution of taxa coupled with uncertain and incomplete information about feeding interactions. These impediments appear insurmountable for most fossil assemblages; however, a few assemblages with excellent soft-body preservation across trophic levels are candidates for food-web data compilation and topological analysis. Here we present plausible, detailed food webs for the Chengjiang and Burgess Shale assemblages from the Cambrian Period. Analyses of degree distributions and other structural network properties, including sensitivity analyses of the effects of uncertainty associated with Cambrian diet designations, suggest that these early Paleozoic communities share remarkably similar topology with modern food webs. Observed regularities reflect a systematic dependence of structure on the numbers of taxa and links in a web. Most aspects of Cambrian food-web structure are well-characterized by a simple "niche model," which was developed for modern food webs and takes into account this scale dependence. However, a few aspects of topology differ between the ancient and recent webs: longer path lengths between species and more species in feeding loops in the earlier Chengjiang web, and higher variability in the number of links per species for both Cambrian webs. Our results are relatively insensitive to the exclusion of low-certainty or random links. The many similarities between Cambrian and recent food webs point toward surprisingly strong and enduring constraints on the organization of complex feeding interactions among metazoan species. The few differences could reflect a transition to more strongly integrated and constrained trophic organization within ecosystems following the rapid diversification of species, body plans, and trophic roles during the Cambrian radiation. More research is needed to explore the generality of food-web structure through deep time and across habitats, especially to investigate potential mechanisms that could give rise to similar structure, as well as any differences. {\textcopyright} 2008 Dunne et al.},

abstract = {The faunal communities of four intertidal habitats namely sand, mud, seagrass (Zostera noltii) and seagrass patches (mixSM) of a temperate coastal lagoon, Ria Formosa (southern Portugal), were sampled. A total of 47 species were taken in 428 bottomless drop sampler samples, with the highest number of species and the more commonly occurring species belonging to the Mollusca phylum. The dominance of these gastropod species underlines the importance of the grazing food chain in these habitats. Bittium reticulatum was the most abundant species, being especially abundant in the seagrass habitat. The most frequent and highest biomass species in the community was Carcinus maenas, a predator that makes use of the available resources and that is adapted to the highly variable intertidal environment. Pomatoschistus microps was the most abundant fish species, with highest densities in the mud habitat, which demonstrates an ability to occupy a low depth area. The seagrass habitat had the highest diversity, abundance and biomass, followed by the mixSM habitat and was different from all the others. Assemblages were highly influenced by the presence of vegetation, providing forage and refuge from predation. A well defined summer group was identified in all habitats. These results highlight the importance of seagrass beds and the idea that their decrease implies the decrease of lagoon production through the impoverishment of the trophic structure of the lagoon. {\textcopyright}2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Their structural complexity gives protection to benthic species by hiding them from predators (Mattila et al., 1999), and providing them food and refuge to their juveniles (Adams et al., 2004). Their being an important source of nutrients increases the secondary production (heterotrophic production) (Dolbeth, Pardal, Lilleb{\o}, Azeiteiro, {\&} Marques, 2003). Epiphytes increase the primary production (autotrophic production) and the habitat complexity (Bologna {\&} Heck, 1999). The combination of the intertidal area and the seagrass area is used by some species to forage in the intertidal zone and then hide in the seagrass zone (Orth et al., 1984). 
The seagrass bed constitutes the habitat with the highest species abundance, species richness and biomass of the Ria Formosa (Almeida et al., 2008). It hosts a lot of different organisms, including predators, scavengers, herbivores and deposit feeders (Alfaro, 2006). Join seagrass beds are important for gastropods like Bittium reticulatum and Rissoa membranacea, which are not found in seagrass patches probably because of their difficulty to move from a patch to the other or because of a simpler habitat that doesn't create a niche for them (Almeida et al., 2008). The most important species present in the ecosystem have been found to be the ones of the taxa Gastropoda, the shore crab (Carcinus maenas) and the common goby (Pomatoschistus microps) (Almeida et al., 2008).

Climate change constitutes another threat exacerbating the symptoms of eutrophication and species migration and loss. Unequivocal evidence of climate change impacts is still highly fragmented despite the intensive research, in part due to the variety and uncertainty of climate models and underlying emission scenarios but also due to the different approaches applied to study its effects. We first describe the strengths and weaknesses of the multi-faceted approaches that are presently available for elucidating the effects of climate change in lakes, including space-for-time substitution, time series, experiments, palaeoecology and modelling. Reviewing combined results from studies based on the various approaches, we describe the likely effects of climate changes on biological communities, trophic dynamics and the ecological state of lakes. We further discuss potential mitigation and adaptation measures to counteract the effects of climate change on lakes and, finally, we highlight some of the future challenges that we face to improve our capacity for successful prediction.},

abstract = {Climate change is shifting species' distribution and phenology. Ecological traits, such as mobility or reproductive mode, explain variation in observed rates of shift for some taxa. However, estimates of relationships between traits and climate responses could be influenced by how responses are measured. We compiled a global data set of 651 published marine species' responses to climate change, from 47 papers on distribution shifts and 32 papers on phenology change. We assessed the relative importance of two classes of predictors of the rate of change, ecological traits of the responding taxa and methodological approaches for quantifying biological responses. Methodological differences explained 22{\%} of the variation in range shifts, more than the 7.8{\%} of the variation explained by ecological traits. For phenology change, methodological approaches accounted for 4{\%} of the variation in measurements, whereas 8{\%} of the variation was explained by ecological traits. Our ability to predict responses from traits was hindered by poor representation of species from the tropics, where temperature isotherms are moving most rapidly. Thus, the mean rate of distribution change may be underestimated by this and other global syntheses. Our analyses indicate that methodological approaches should be explicitly considered when designing, analysing and comparing results among studies. To improve climate impact studies, we recommend that (1) reanalyses of existing time series state how the existing data sets may limit the inferences about possible climate responses; (2) qualitative comparisons of species' responses across different studies be limited to studies with similar methodological approaches; (3) meta-analyses of climate responses include methodological attributes as covariates; and (4) that new time series be designed to include the detection of early warnings of change or ecologically relevant change. Greater consideration of methodological attributes will improve the accuracy of analyses that seek to quantify the role of climate change in species' distribution and phenology changes.},

abstract = {Climate change has caused deserts, already defined by climatic extremes, to warm and dry more rapidly than other ecoregions in the contiguous United States over the last 50 years. Desert birds persist near the edge of their physiological limits, and climate change could cause lethal dehydration and hyperthermia, leading to decline or extirpation of some species. We evaluated how desert birds have responded to climate and habitat change by resurveying historic sites throughout the Mojave Desert that were originally surveyed for avian diversity during the early 20th century by Joseph Grinnell and colleagues. We found strong evidence of an avian community in collapse. Sites lost on average 43{\%} of their species, and occupancy probability declined significantly for 39 of 135 breeding birds. The common raven was the only native species to substantially increase across survey sites. Climate change, particularly decline in precipitation, was the most important driver of site-level persistence, while habitat change had a secondary influence. Habitat preference and diet were the two most important species traits associated with occupancy change. The presence of surface water reduced the loss of site-level richness, creating refugia. The collapse of the avian community over the past century may indicate a larger imbalance in the Mojave and provide an early warning of future ecosystem disintegration, given climate models unanimously predict an increasingly dry and hot future.},

abstract = {There is a host of network measures provided by ecological network analysis in order to better understand food webs. A key question is which network indices to use in studying a particular problem, especially because the biological meaning of many indices is poorly understood. We argue that one aspect to consider when making this decision is the sensitivity of network measures to temporal data aggregation. Aggregating food web data in time is not a matter of choice: to some extent, every food web is temporally aggregated. We present a simple survey on how five global network measures behave when aggregating food web data in three time series. We study connectance (C), average distance (AD) and the network centralization index for degree centrality (NCIDC), closeness centrality (NCICC) and betweenness centrality (NCIBC). These indices describe the richness (C) and arrangement (the other four) of links in food webs. We focus on differences between indices, not between ecosystems or seasons. The first question is how variable the values of particular indices are in the time series. NCIBC is the most variable index, possibly reflecting changes in the relative role of species (components) during the year. AD is the most constant index suggesting not much change in the average speed of spreading indirect effects in the studied networks. Some indices, especially average distance (AD) are highly sensitive to temporal aggregation: the value of the aggregated (cumulative) network can be far from the range of seasonal values. Using an index like this for aggregated data is clearly misleading. High quality, comparable food web time series are not very common. There is still much work to be done in describing and collecting them in order to gain integrative and comparative knowledge on the behavior of particular indices during temporal food web aggregation. Doing so, progress in network analysis could compensate for the methodological difficulties of network description. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Paine1980,
abstract = {A review paper of Paine's previous work with emphasis on strong and weak species' interactions. The paper states that the strength or importance of a trophic relationship cannot be assumed equivalent for all web species. Some species will be a strong interactor and will have pronounced effects on the community. An example is Pisaster ochraceus' predation on Mytilus californianus. Other species will have little or no effect on the community upon removal. Therefore just enumerating links of a food web provides little information on species' importance or role in the community. What counts instead is the interaction strength of the predator or the competitive stature of the preferred prey. Paine suggests that the next generation of food web ecologists be more sensitive to interaction strength and less so to trophic complexity.},

abstract = {Biodiversity is organised into complex ecological networks of interacting species in local ecosystems, but our knowledge about the effects of habitat fragmentation on such systems remains limited. We consider the effects of this key driver of both local and global change on both mutualistic and antagonistic systems at different levels of biological organisation and spatiotemporal scales. There is a complex interplay of patterns and processes related to the variation and influence of spatial, temporal and biotic drivers in ecological networks. Species traits (e.g. body size, dispersal ability) play an important role in determining how networks respond to fragment size and isolation, edge shape and permeability, and the quality of the surrounding landscape matrix. Furthermore, the perception of spatial scale (e.g. environmental grain) and temporal effects (time lags, extinction debts) can differ markedly among species, network modules and trophic levels, highlighting the need to develop a more integrated perspective that considers not just nodes, but the structural role and strength of species interactions (e.g. as hubs, spatial couplers and determinants of connectance, nestedness and modularity) in response to habitat fragmentation. Many challenges remain for improving our understanding: the likely importance of specialisation, functional redundancy and trait matching has been largely overlooked. The potentially critical effects of apex consumers, abundant species and super-generalists on network changes and evolutionary dynamics also need to be addressed in future research. Ultimately, spatial and ecological networks need to be combined to explore the effects of dispersal, colonisation, extinction and habitat fragmentation on network structure and coevolutionary dynamics. Finally, we need to embed network approaches more explicitly within applied ecology in general, because they offer great potential for improving on the current species-based or habitat-centric approaches to our management and conservation of biodiversity in the face of environmental change.},

abstract = {The effect of variable concentrations of dissolved molecular carbon dioxide, [CO(2,aq)], on C:N:P ratios in marine phytoplankton was studied in batch cultures under high light, nutrient-replete conditions at different irradiance cycles. The elemental composition in six out of seven species tested was affected by variation in [CO(2,aq)]. Among these species, the magnitude of change in C:N:P was similar over the experimental CO2 range. Differences in both cell size and day length-dependent growth rate had little effect on the critical CO2 concentration below which a further decrease in [CO(2,aq)] led to large changes in C:N:P ratios. Significant CO2-related changes in elemental ratios were observed at [CO(2,aq)] {\textless} 10 $\mu$mol kg-1 and correlated with a CO2-dependent decrease in growth rate. At [CO(2,aq)] typical for ocean surface waters, variation in C:N:P was relatively small under our experimental conditions. No general pattern for CO2-related changes in the elemental composition could be found with regard to the direction of trends. Either an increase or a decrease in C:N and C:P with increasing [CO(2,aq)] was observed, depending on the species tested. Diurnal variation in C:N and C:P, tested in Skeletonema costatum, was of a similar magnitude as CO2-related variation. In this species, the CO2 effect was superimposed on diurnal variation, indicating that differences in elemental ratios at the end of the photoperiod were not caused by a transient buildup of carbon-rich storage compounds due to a more rapid accumulation of carbohydrates at high CO2 concentrations. If our results obtained under high light, nutrient-replete conditions are representative for natural phytoplankton populations, CO2-related changes in plankton stoichiometry are unlikely to have a significant effect on the oceanic carbon cycle.},

abstract = {Ecological networks depict the interactions between species, mainly based on observations in the field. The information contained in such interac-tion matrices depends on the sampling design, and typically, compounds preferences (specialization) and abundances (activity). Null models are the primary vehicles to disentangle the effects of specialization from those of sampling and abundance, but they ignore the feedback of network structure on abundances. Hence, network structure, as exemplified here by modu-larity, is difficult to link to specific causes. Indeed, various processes lead to modularity and to specific interaction patterns more generally. Inferring (co)evolutionary dynamics is even more challenging, as competition and trait matching yield identical patterns of interactions. A satisfactory resolution of the underlying factors determining network structure will require substan-tial additional information, not only on independently assessed abundances, but also on traits, and ideally on fitness consequences as measured in exper-imental setups.},

abstract = {The development of approaches to estimate the vulnerability of biological communities and ecosystems to extirpations and reductions of species is a central challenge of conservation biology. One key aim of this challenge is to develop quantitative approaches to estimate and rank interaction strengths and keystoneness of species and functional groups, i.e. to quantify the relative importance of species. Network analysis can be a powerful tool for this because certain structural aspects of ecological networks are good indicators of the mechanisms that maintain co-evolved, biotic interactions. A static view of ecological networks would lead us to focus research on highly-central species in food webs (topological key players in ecosystems). There are a variety of centrality indices, developed for several types of ecological networks (e.g. for weighted and un-weighted webs). However, truly understanding extinction and its community-wide effects requires the use of dynamic models. Deterministic dynamic models are feasible when population sizes are sufficiently large to minimize noise in the overall system. In models with small population sizes, stochasticity can be modelled explicitly. We present a stochastic simulation-based ecosystem model for identification of "dynamic key species" in situations where stochastic models are appropriate. To demonstrate this approach, we simulated ecosystem dynamics and performed sensitivity analysis using data from the Prince William Sound, Alaska ecosystem model. We then compare these results to those of purely topological analyses and deterministic dynamic (Ecosim) studies. We present the relationships between various topological and dynamic indices and discuss their biological relevance. The trophic group with the largest effect on others is nearshore demersals, the species mostly sensitive to others is halibut, and the group of both considerable effect on and sensitivity to others is juvenile herring. The most important trophic groups in our dynamical simulations appear to have intermediate trophic levels. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The widespread relevance of increasingly complex networks requires methods to extract meaningful coarse-grained representations of such systems. For undirected graphs, standard community detection methods use criteria largely based on density of connections to provide such representations. We propose a method for grouping nodes in directed networks based on the role of the nodes in the network, understood in terms of patterns of incoming and outgoing flows. The role groupings are obtained through the clustering of a similarity matrix, formed by the distances between feature vectors that contain the number of in and out paths of all lengths for each node. Hence nodes operating in a similar flow environment are grouped together although they may not themselves be densely connected. Our method, which includes a scale factor that reveals robust groupings based on increasingly global structure, provides an alternative criterion to uncover structure in networks where there is an implicit flow transfer in the system. We illustrate its application to a variety of data from ecology, world trade and cellular metabolism.},

abstract = {Press perturbations, in which one or more species densities are experimentally altered and held at higher or lower levels, are common field approaches used to understand community dynamics. The outcomes of such experiments are often difficult to anticipate solely on the basis of intuition. This is because the effects of a perturbation may pass through a complex network of direct and indirect pathways in a food web, and the outcome may be highly sensitive to the strength of interactions among species. One solution to understanding outcomes of press experiments is to quantify first the community matrix, the matrix of measured direct interactions between all species in a food web, and then obtain the inverse of this matrix. The inverse of the community matrix predicts the effect of all species presses on all other species. I evaluated the utility of the inverse community matrix in predicting the outcomes of press experiments in an old-field food web. I used data from field and laboratory experiments to quantify the interaction strengths between grasshoppers, four old-field plants, and nitrogen supply. These values were used to parameterize the community matrix and obtain its inverse in a Monte Carlo simulation. The simulation was used to predict the mean and standard error in the outcome of a simultaneous nitrogen and herbivore press on food-web structure and dynamics. The predictions were compared with data from an enclosure experiment in the field in which I manipulated nitrogen supply and herbivore abundance. There was a high degree of uncertainty predicted and observed in the study system. Despite this, I show that the degree and the sources of uncertainty were predictable for each species. This suggests that the inverse community matrix offers a useful theoretical benchmark for understanding the outcome of field press experiments.},

abstract = {Recent experiments have provided some evidence that loss of biodiversity may impair the functioning and sustainability of ecosystems. However, we still lack adequate theories and models to provide robust generalizations, predictions, and interpretations for such results. Here I present a mechanistic model of a spatially structured ecosystem in which plants compete for a limiting soil nutrient. This model shows that plant species richness does not necessarily enhance ecosystem processes, but it identifies two types of factors that could generate such an effect: (i) complementarity among species in the space they occupy below ground and (ii) positive correlation between mean resource-use intensity and diversity. In both cases, the model predicts that plant biomass, primary productivity, and nutrient retention all increase with diversity, similar to results reported in recent field experiments. These two factors, however, have different implications for the understanding of the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. The model also shows that the effect of species richness on productivity or other ecosystem processes is masked by the effects of physical environmental parameters on these processes. Therefore, comparisons among sites cannot reveal it, unless abiotic conditions are very tightly controlled. Identifying and separating out the mechanisms behind ecosystem responses to biodiversity should become the focus of future experiments.},

For endangered or invasive species, management decisions are often based on small demographic data sets. Hence, there is a need for population models which accurately assess population performance from such small data sets. 2. We used demographic data on two perennial herbs with different life histories to compare the accuracy and precision of the traditional matrix population model and the recently developed integral projection model (IPM) in relation to the amount of data. 3. For large data sets both matrix models and IPMs produced identical estimates of population growth rate ($\lambda$). However, for small data sets containing fewer than 300 individuals, IPMs often produced smaller bias and variance for $\lambda$ than matrix models despite different matrix structures and sampling techniques used to construct the matrix population models. 4.Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that the smaller bias and variance of $\lambda$ estimates make IPMs preferable to matrix population models for small demographic data sets with a few hundred individuals. These results are likely to be applicable to a wide range of herbaceous, perennial plant species where demographic fate can be modelled as a function of a continuous state variable such as size. We recommend the use of IPMs to assess population performance and management strategies particularly for endangered or invasive perennial herbs where little demographic data are available. {\textcopyright} 2009 British Ecological Society.},

One is of mathematical nature involving network analysis where unique species can be defined as those whose topological position is very different to others in the same food web. A species is unique if it has very different connection pattern compared to others. The second approach is of biological nature, based on trait-based aggregations. Unique species are not easy to aggregate with others because their traits are not in common with the ones of most others. Our goal here is to illustrate how mathematics can provide an alternative perspective on species aggregation, and how this is related to its biological counterpart. We illustrate these approaches using a toy food web and a real food web and demonstrate the sensitive relationships between those approaches. The trait-based aggregation focusing on the trait values of size (sv) can be best predicted by the mathematical aggregation algorithms.},

After examining the treeline environment and the tree growth with respect to elevation, possible effects of climate change on carbon gain and water relations derived from space-for-time studies and manipulative experiments are outlined. Finally, long-term observational records are discussed, working towards conclusions on tree growth in a future, warmer environment. Increases in CO2 levels along with climate warming interact in complex ways on trees at the treeline. Because treeline trees are not carbon limited, climate warming (rather than the rising atmospheric CO2 level) causes alterations in the ecological functioning of the treeline ecotone in the Central Austrian Alps. Although the water uptake from soils is improved by further climate warming due to an increased permeability of root membranes and aquaporin-mediated changes in root conductivity, tree survival at the treeline also depends on competitiveness for belowground resources. The currently observed seedling re-establishment at the treeline in the Central European Alps is an invasion into potential habitats due to decreasing grazing pressure rather than an upward-migration due to climate warming, suggesting that the treeline in the Central Austrian Alps behaves in a conservative way. Nevertheless, to understand the altitude of the treeline, one must also consider seedling establishment. As there is a lack of knowledge on this particular topic within the treeline ecotone in the Central Austrian Alps, we conclude further research has to focus on the importance of this life stage for evaluating treeline shifts and limits in a changing environment.},

abstract = {Most climate change predictions omit species interactions and interspecific variation in dispersal. Here, we develop a model of multiple competing species along awarming climatic gradient that includes temperaturedependent competition, differences in niche breadth and interspecific differences in dispersal ability. Competition and dispersal differences decreased diversity and produced so-called 'no-analogue' communities, defined as a novel combination of species that does not currently co-occur. Climate change altered community richness the most when species had narrow niches, when mean community-wide dispersal rates were low and when species differed in dispersal abilities. With high interspecific dispersal variance, the best dispersers tracked climate change, out-competed slower dispersers and caused their extinction. Overall, competition slowed the advance of colonists into newly suitable habitats, creating lags in climate tracking. We predict that climate change will most threaten communities of species that have narrow niches (e.g. tropics), vary in dispersal (most communities) and compete strongly. Current forecasts probably underestimate climate change impacts on biodiversity by neglecting competition and dispersal differences. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic climate change is altering the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. Agricultural systems are particularly vulnerable to climate change as they are frequently disturbed by intensified management practices. This also threatens belowground organisms that are responsible for providing crucial ecosystem functions and services, such as nutrient cycling and plant disease suppression. Amongst these organisms, earthworms are of particular importance as they can modulate the effects of climate change on soil organisms by modifying the biotic and abiotic soil conditions. However, they are also known to decline under intensified management, justifying their use as key biotic indicators of intensified agriculture. Yet, our knowledge of the responses of belowground species to the interacting effects of warming and land-use intensification (simulated by earthworm reduction in the experimental setup) remains limited. Here, we tested the interactive effects of soil warming and reduced earthworm densities on soil protists, nematodes, meso- and macrofauna, and their diversity in a common barley system in the Hohenheim Climate Change Experiment. We found that belowground species richness was lowest at elevated temperature and reduced earthworm densities, indicating that earthworms can buffer warming effects on belowground biodiversity. Furthermore, warming increased the densities of plant-feeding nematodes, and herbivorous macrofauna benefitted from reduced earthworm densities. Our results indicate that warming and reduced earthworm densities may simultaneously modify the functioning and service provisioning of soils via shifts in diversity and density of soil biota that would likely lead to simplified belowground food webs. These findings thus highlight the importance of maintaining greater densities of ecosystem engineers like earthworms that may help buffering the detrimental effects of climate warming in agricultural systems.},

abstract = {We review empirical studies on how bioinvasions alter food webs and how a food-web perspective may change their prediction and management. Predation is found to underlie the most spectacular damage in invaded systems, sometimes cascading down to primary producers. Indirect trophic effects (exploitative and apparent competition) also affect native species, but rarely provoke extinctions, while invaders often have positive bottom-up effects on higher trophic levels. As a result of these trophic interactions, and of nontrophic ones such as mutualisms or ecosystem engineering, invasions can profoundly modify the structure of the entire food web. While few studies have been undertaken at this scale, those that have highlight how network properties such as species richness, phenotypic diversity, and functional diversity, limit the likelihood and impacts of invasions by saturating niche space. Vulnerable communities have unsaturated niche space mainly because of evolutionary history in isolation (islands), dispersal limitation, or anthropogenic disturbance. Evolution also modulates the insertion of invaders into a food web. Exotics and natives are evolutionarily new to one another, and invasion tends to retain alien species that happen to have advantage over residents in trophic interactions. Resident species, therefore, often rapidly evolve traits to better tolerate or exploit invaders—a process that may eventually restore more balanced food webs and prevent extinctions. We discuss how network-based principles might guide management policies to better live with invaders, rather than to undertake the daunting (and often illusory) task of eradicating them one by one.},

@article{Warwick1998,
abstract = {A further biodiversity index is proposed, based on taxonomic (or phylogenetic) relatedness of species, namely the 'variation in taxonomic distinctness' (VarTD, Lambda (+)) between every pair of species recorded in a study. It complements the previously defined 'average taxonomic distinctness' (AvTD, Delta (+)), which is the mean path length through the taxonomic tree connecting every pair of species in the list. VarTD is simply the variance of these pairwise path lengths and reflects the unevenness of the taxonomic tree. For example, a species list in which there are several different orders represented only by a single species, but also some genera which are very species-rich, would give a high Lambda (+) by comparison with a list (of equivalent Delta (+)) in which all species tended to be from different families but the same order. VarTD is shown to have the same desirable sampling properties as AvTD, primarily a lack of dependence of its mean value on the sample size (except for unrealistically small samples). Such unbiasedness is of crucial importance in making valid biodiversity comparisons between studies at different locations or times, with differing or uncontrolled degrees of sampling effort, This feature is emphatically not shared by indices related to species richness and also not by properties of the phylogeny adapted from proposals in other, conservation contexts, such as 'average phylogenetic diversity' (AvPD, Phi (+)). As with AvTD, the VarTD statistic for any local study can be tested for 'departure from expectation', based on a master taxonomy for that region, by constructing a simulation distribution from random subsets of the master list. The idea can be extended to summarising the joint distribution of AvTD and VarTD, so that values from real data sets are compared with a fitted simulation 'envelope' in a 2 d (Delta (+), Lambda (+)) plot. The methodology is applied to 14 species lists of free-living marine nematodes, and related to a master list for UK waters. The combination of AvTD and VarTD picks out, in different ways, some degraded locations (low Delta (+), low to normal Lambda (+)) and the pristine island fauna of the Scillies (normal Delta (+), high Lambda (+)). The 2 indices are also demonstrated to be measuring effectively independent features of the taxonomic tree, at least for this faunal group (although it is shown theoretically that this will not always be the case). The combination of Delta (+) and Lambda (+) is therefore seen to provide a statistically robust summary of taxonomic (or phylogenetic) relatedness patterns within an assemblage, which has the potential to be applied to a wide range of historical data in the form of simple species lists.},

Unfortunately, chimpanzee density is notoriously difficult to determine, making it difficult to assess potential chimpanzee conservation areas. The objective of this study was to determine whether chimpanzee density could be predicted from the density of trees that produce large, fleshy fruits. Using chimpanzee nest counts from six sites within Kibale National Park, Uganda, collected during a year-long study, a predictive trend was found between chimpanzee nest density and large, fleshy-fruit tree density. This relationship may offer a quick, reasonably reliable method of estimating potential chimpanzee densities in previously unsurveyed habitats and may be used to evaluate the suitability of possible re-introduction sites. Thus, in conjunction with other survey techniques, such as forest reconnaissance, it may provide an effective and efficient means of determining appropriate chimpanzee habitat in which to allocate conservation efforts.},

Lefkovitch proposes to study a population through the subdivision of it into different life stages rather than age. This is due mainly to the fact that rarely the age of the individuals is known. 
MODEL
It just describes the theory and methodology behind the matrix population models. 
The eigenvalue (dominant root) of the initial population composition is e{\^{}}rm. This means that if a matrix multiplied per the population vector results in not altering its relative composition, the population grows of e{\^{}}rm. 
RELATIONSHIPS WITH SOME OTHER MODELS
Lefktovich admits that to allow the model to work, the species shouldn't have any inter and intraspecific competition, infinite food and space and live in a stable environment. If the matrix remains the same then it is equal to r. 
EXPERIMENTAL OBSERVATIONS
He provides an example based on the population growth of the cigarette beetle (Lasioderma seericorne.

abstract = {Climate warming can directly affect traits and demographic rates of organisms. However, individuals are embedded in complex networks of ecological interactions with other members of the community, allowing for a range of direct and indirect effects that depend on the trophic structure of the community. Here we show that effects of warming (i.e. increase in mean temperature) on a given species can strongly depend on the community context and trophic complexity of the system. Specifically, we manipulated the presence/ absence of two competing tadpole species and their dragonfly predators to simulate different food webs of increasing complexity that were exposed to ambient or warmed conditions. We found that warming dramatically reduced herbivore (tadpole) survival in the absence of strong interspecific competition and predation, but it had no measureable effect on demographic rates on the dominant competitor in more complex communities where it was exposed to interspecific competition and predation. Conversely, our results also indicate that warming reduced the strength of interspecific competition and predation in our system. These results suggest that trophic complexity could potentially buffer climate change effects on populations and emphasize that we often cannot predict the effects of changes in abiotic conditions on a given population without accounting for the community context.},

They may also be particularly vulnerable to current warming trends. 2. Forty-eight tanks were used to create 3-m3 mesocosms of shallow lake communities, in which the effects of warming by 4 °C and regular nutrient loading at two levels relevant to current degrees of eutrophication were studied in the presence and absence of fish. 3. Warming changed concentrations of soluble phosphate, total nitrogen and conductivity, increased total plant biomass and decreased the amount of phytoplankton through shading by floating plants. Nutrient additions decreased total plant biomass but increased floating plant biomass. Nitrogen increase and warming increased floating plant biomass and decreased plant species richness. The plant community remained intact and did not switch to the turbid-water, phytoplankton-dominated community often predicted to be a consequence of global warming and eutrophication. 4. Synthesis and applications. Likely future temperature increase will exacerbate some, but not all symptoms of eutrophication in shallow lakes. Alone it will not cause a switch from plant-dominated to algal-dominated systems, but may result in nuisance growths of floating lemnids.

This review examines the potential role of the emerging synthetic discipline of evolutionary community ecology in improving our understanding of how climate change will alter future distribution of biodiversity. We review theoretical and empirical advances about the role of niche evolution, interspecific interactions, and their interplay in altering species geographic ranges and community assembly. We discuss potential ways to integrate complex feedbacks between ecology and evolution in ecological forecasting.

Although conceptually robust, it has proven difficult to find practical measures of niche width that are simple to obtain, yet provide an adequate descriptor of the ecological position of the population examined. 2. Trophic niche has proven more tractable than other niche dimensions. However, indices used as a proxy for trophic niche width often suffer from the following difficulties. Such indices rarely lie along a single scale making comparisons between populations or species difficult; have difficulty in combining dietary prey diversity and evenness in an ecologically meaningful way; and fail to integrate diet over ecological time-scales thus usually only comprise single snapshots of niche width. 3. We propose an alternative novel method for the comparison of trophic niche width: the use of variance of tissue stable isotope ratios, especially those of nitrogen and carbon. 4. This approach is a potentially powerful method of measuring trophic niche width, particularly if combined with conventional approaches, because: it provides a single measure on a continuous axis that is common to all species; it integrates information on only assimilated prey over time; the integration period changes with choice of tissue sampled; and data production is theoretically fast and testing among populations simple. 5. Empirical studies are now required to test the benefits of using isotopic variance as a measure of niche width, and in doing so help refine this approach.},

abstract = {There is a growing interest in using trait-based approaches to characterize the functional structure of animal communities. Quantitative methods have been derived mostly for plant ecology, but it is now common to characterize the functional composition of various systems such as soils, coral reefs, pelagic food webs or terrestrial vertebrate communities. With the ever-increasing availability of distribution and trait data, a quantitative method to represent the different roles of animals in a community promise to find generalities that will facilitate cross-system comparisons. There is, however, currently no theory relating the functional composition of food webs to their dynamics and properties. The intuitive interpretation that more functional diversity leads to higher resource exploitation and better ecosystem functioning was brought from plant ecology and does not apply readily to food webs. Here we appraise whether there are interpretable metrics to describe the functional composition of food webs that could foster a better understanding of their structure and functioning. We first distinguish the various roles that traits have on food web topology, resource extraction (bottom-up effects), trophic regulation (top-down effects), and the ability to keep energy and materials within the community. We then discuss positive effects of functional trait diversity on food webs, such as niche construction and bottom-up effects. We follow with a discussion on the negative effects of functional diversity, such as enhanced competition (both exploitation and apparent) and top-down control. Our review reveals that most of our current understanding of the impact of functional trait diversity on food web properties and functioning comes from an over-simplistic representation of network structure with well-defined levels. We, therefore, conclude with propositions for new research avenues for both theoreticians and empiricists.},

abstract = {Food webs are the complex networks of trophic interactions that stoke the metabolic fires of life. To understand what structures these interactions in natural communities, ecologists have developed simple models to capture their main architectural features. However, apparently realistic food webs can be generated by models invoking either predator-prey body-size hierarchies or evolutionary constraints as structuring mechanisms. As a result, this approach has not conclusively revealed which factors are the most important. Here we cut to the heart of this debate by directly comparing the influence of phylogeny and body size on food web architecture. Using data from 13 food webs compiled by direct observation, we confirm the importance of both factors. Nevertheless, phylogeny dominates in most networks. Moreover, path analysis reveals that the size-independent direct effect of phylogeny on trophic structure typically outweighs the indirect effect that could be captured by considering body size alone. Furthermore, the phylogenetic signal is asymmetric: closely related species overlap in their set of consumers far more than in their set of resources. This is at odds with several food web models, which take only the view-point of consumers when assigning interactions. The echo of evolutionary history clearly resonates through current food webs, with implications for our theoretical models and conservation priorities. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Royal Society.},

Twenty of the thirty species studied, mainly Charadriiformes, winter in and/or migrate through Tavira. The species distribution patterns were highly influenced by habitat – mostly because of the vast diversity of habitats available such as intertidal mud, mud/sand flats and saltworks – and to a lesser degree by tide and month. Migrant species, all gregarious, were the most characteristic of the saltworks during low tide. Non-tidal habitats were used as alternative foraging sites at high tide in summer, but these were also the main foraging sites used during migration periods, significantly supporting several migrant shorebird populations. Overall, this study reinforces the idea that even small estuaries, like that at Tavira, play a crucial role for considerable numbers of shorebirds during migration.},

The past centuries have witnessed the loss of many intertidal habitats because of humans: these areas are really important for different birds that forage there (Fonseca, Grade, {\&} Da Fonseca, 2004). However, some human made habitats such as the saltworks provide them a place where to forage and roost ((Masero, P{\'{e}}rez-Hurtado, Castro, {\&} Arroyo, 2000). Waders have been demonstrated to make a great use out of the salinas in Ria Formosa (be more specific). The bird community composition is mainly influenced by the habitat and not by the month or the tide. Southern Portugal is a really important habitat in the East Atlantic flyway (Fonseca, Grade, {\&} Da Fonseca, 2004). It hosts a great variety of different migratory wetland species: this is mainly due to the favourable climate and the high sources of food (Fonseca, Grade, {\&} Da Fonseca, 2004).},

abstract = {This report particularly concerns with the habitat and day time behaviour of the red lutung (Presbytis melalophos) inhabiting the Bukit Sebelah Protection Forest (West Sumatera). This monkey is endemic to Sumatera and generally resides in home ranges on riversides. An investigation on the behaviour and ecology of P. melalophos was made from July to August 1986 at a field site in the Bukit Sebelah Protection Forest. The vegetation of the habitat was analyzed with the use of the point centered quarter method on three parallel running transects, 200 m apart, each of 1000 m length, where 50 m spaced quadratic sample plots were laid out. The tree species diversity in the habitat was determined by the use of Shannon Wiener formula. The dominance of the tree species were ranked after their important values. The daytime activities of the monkey in its home range were observed from 6.30 a.m. to 6.30 p.m. The result of the vegetation analysis showed that the stand density in the habitat was 369 trees/ha with a basal area of 93.2447 m2/ha and the diversity index was 4.655. Twelve species with important values of more than 10 percent were considered dominant, among which Hevea brasiliensis had the highest I.V. while Ficus variegata took the second place, having stand densities of 19.16 and 7.08 trees/ha respectively. Most of the monkeys fed on the foliage of both trees. The monkeys congregated in small size groups made up of 2-8 individuals and led by one adult male.},

Two approaches were used: space for time substitution approach, i.e., comparing invaded and uninvaded sites under the same habitat conditions, and removal of the invader from experimental plots. Differences in the number of species, Shannon diversity index H′ and evennes J were compared between invaded and uninvaded plots. Uninvaded plots of the comparative study harboured by 0.23 more species per 16m2, and had higher value of H′ and J, calculated with species covers as importance values; however only the difference in J was marginally significant (p=0.04). Other effects were not significant, indicating that once I. glandulifera is removed, communities recover without any consequences for species diversity. Multivariate analysis did not reveal any effect of invasion on the species composition in terms of species presence but their cover hierarchies changed after the invasion, as I. glandulifera became dominant at the expense of tall native nitrophilous dominants. It is concluded that I. glandulifera exerts negligible effect on the characteristics of invaded riparian communities, hence it does not represent threat to the plant diversity of invaded areas. This makes it very different from other Central European invasive aliens of a similar performance.},

abstract = {Species Distribution Models (SDMs) generally ignore biotic processes. However, it has been shown that biotic interactions from lowland flora contribute to shape the "rear edge" of alpine plant distributions. In this study, we explored the potential effect of accounting for interactions from dominant lowland congeners representative for the lowland flora for predicting landscape scale distribution (1. km grain) of two alpine plant species, Viola biflora and Veronica alpina. In a first classical approach, we include the lowland species probabilities of occurrence as covariates in the alpine species landscape scale models (covariate models). In a second novel approach, we first used SDMs to predict the distribution of the two alpine plants at the landscape scale. We then searched for interactive effects with the lowland species, and used this information to re-predict the landscape parts where alpine and lowland species were previously predicted to co-occur (abiotic + biotic models).Our 'abiotic + biotic' model improved model precision for both alpine species; but statistically significantly for Viola biflora only. In contrast, the classical covariate approach did not affect the prediction accuracy of Viola biflora and decreased the prediction accuracy for Veronica alpina. This seemed to be caused by collinearity between abiotic and biotic predictors, highlighting potential problems with the conventional method used to account for biotic interactions in SDM. Including potential effects of biotic interactions can improve predictions of alpine species' ranges at the landscape scale. Ignoring biotic interactions in SDM may lead to biased predictions that are likely to overestimate realized climatic niches and so species distributions. The abiotic + biotic approach can constitute a robust method to account for biotic interactions in SDM. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The aim of our study was to investigate the influence of spatial heterogeneity and environmental complexity on the distribution of ant functional groups and species diversity along altitudinal gradients in a temperate ecosystem (Pyrenees Mountains). During three summers, we sampled 20 sites distributed across two Pyrenean valleys ranging in altitude from 1,009 to 2,339 m by using pitfall traps and hand collection. The environment around each sampling points was characterized by using both physical and land-cover variables. We then used a self-organizing map algorithm (SOM, neural network) to detect and characterize the relationship between the spatial distribution of ant functional groups, species diversity, and the variables measured. The use of SOM allowed us to reduce the apparent complexity of the environment to five clusters that highlighted two main gradients: an altitudinal gradient and a gradient of environmental closure. The composition of ant functional groups and species diversity changed along both of these gradients and was differently affected by environmental variables. The SOM also allowed us to validate the contours of most ant functional groups by highlighting the response of these groups to the environmental and land-cover variables.},

abstract = {Mechanisms that explain shifts in species composition over environmental gradients continue to intrigue ecologists. Ecological stoichiometry has recently provided a new potential mechanism linking resource (light and nutrient) supply gradients to grazer performance via elemental food-quality mechanisms. More specifically, it predicts that light and nutrient gradients should determine the relative dominance of P-rich taxa, such as Daphnia, in grazer assemblages. We tested this hypothesis in pond mesocosms (cattle tanks) by creating gradients of resource supply and predation risk, to which we added diverse assemblages of algal producer and zooplankton grazer species. We then characterized the end-point composition of grazer assemblages and quantity and elemental food quality of edible algae. We found that somatically P-rich Daphnia only dominated grazer assemblages in high-nutrient, no-predator treatments. In these ecosystems, P sequestered in producers exceeded a critical concentration. However, other grazers having even higher body P content did not respond similarly. These grazers were often abundant in low-nutrient environments with poorer food quality. At face value, this result is problematic for ecological stoichiometry because body composition did not correctly predict response of these other species. However, two potential explanations could maintain consistency with stoichiometric principles: species could differentially use a high-P resource (bacteria), or body composition might not always directly correlate with nutrient demands of grazers. Although our data cannot differentiate between these explanations, both suggest potential avenues for future empirical and theoretical study.},

abstract = {1. The loss of a species from an ecological community can trigger a cascade of secondary extinctions. Here we investigate how the complexity (connectance) of model communities affects their response to species loss. Using dynamic analysis based on a global criterion of persistence (permanence) and topological analysis we investigate the extent of secondary extinctions following the loss of different kinds of species. 2. We show that complex communities are, on average, more resistant to species loss than simple communities: the number of secondary extinctions decreases with increasing connectance. However, complex communities are more vulnerable to loss of top predators than simple communities. 3. The loss of highly connected species (species with many links to other species) and species at low trophic levels triggers, on average, the largest number of secondary extinctions. The effect of the connectivity of a species is strongest in webs with low connectance. 4. Most secondary extinctions are due to direct bottom-up effects: consumers go extinct when their resources are lost. Secondary extinctions due to trophic cascades and disruption of predator-mediated coexistence also occur. Secondary extinctions due to disruption of predator-mediated coexistence are more common in complex communities than in simple communities, while bottom-up and top-down extinction cascades are more common in simple communities. 5.

We investigate how the use of mean W and mean N or B, rather than other measures of W and/or accounting for the properties of all individuals, can affect the outcome of tests of macroecological and food web theory. 3. Theoretical and empirical analyses demonstrate that mean W, W at maximum biomass (Wmb), W when energy requirements are greatest (Wme) and the W when a species uses the greatest proportion of the energy available to all species in a W class (W mpe) are not consistently related. 4. For a population at equilibrium, relationships between mean W and Wme depend on the slope b of the relationship between trophic level and W. For marine fishes, data show that b varies widely among species and thus mean W is an unreliable indicator of the role of a species in the food web. 5. Two different approaches, 'cross-species' and 'all individuals' have been used to estimate slopes of abundance-body mass relationships and to test the energetic equivalence hypothesis and related theory. The approaches, based on relationships between (1) log10 mean W and log10 mean N or B, and (2) log 10W and log10N or B of all individuals binned into log10 W classes (size spectra), give different slopes and confidence intervals with the same data. 6. Our results show that the 'all individuals' approach has the potential to provide more powerful tests of the energetic equivalence hypothesis and role of energy availability in determining slopes, but new theory and empirical analysis are needed to explain distributions of species relative abundance at W. 7. Biases introduced when working with mean W in macroecological and food web studies are greatest when species have indeterminate growth, when relationships between W and trophic level are strong and when the range of species' W is narrow. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Authors.},

In this article, we highlight another property that is found in many networks, the property of community structure, in which network nodes are joined together in tightly knit groups, between which there are only looser connections. We propose a method for detecting such communities, built around the idea of using centrality indices to find community boundaries. We test our method on computer-generated and real-world graphs whose community structure is already known and find that the method detects this known structure with high sensitivity and reliability. We also apply the method to two networks whose community structure is not well known-a collaboration network and a food web-and find that it detects significant and informative community divisions in both cases.},

Analysing the effects of species loss in model communities we found that removal of the following species categories triggered, on average, the largest number of secondary extinctions: (a) rare species interacting strongly with many consumers, (b) abundant basal species interacting weakly with their consumers and (c) abundant intermediate species interacting strongly with many resources. We also found that the keystone status of a species with given characteristics was context dependent, that is, dependent on the structure of the community where it was embedded.

abstract = {While the mechanistic links between animal movement and population dynamics are ecologically obvious, it is much less clear when knowledge of animal movement is a prerequisite for understanding and predicting population dynamics. GPS and other technologies enable detailed tracking of animal location concurrently with acquisition of landscape data and information on individual physiology. These tools can be used to refine our understanding of the mechanistic links between behaviour and individual condition through 'spatially informed' movement models where time allocation to different behaviours affects individual survival and reproduction. For some species, socially informed models that address the movements and average fitness of differently sized groups and how they are affected by fission-fusion processes at relevant temporal scales are required. Furthermore, as most animals revisit some places and avoid others based on their previous experiences, we foresee the incorporation of long-term memory and intention in movement models. The way animals move has important consequences for the degree of mixing that we expect to find both within a population and between individuals of different species. The mixing rate dictates the level of detail required by models to capture the influence of heterogeneity and the dynamics of intra- and interspecific interaction. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society.},
annote = {ABSTRACT
1) GPS collars can be used to keep track of moovements and physiology of different individuals
2) We need to understand how fission-fusion processes affect the movement and average fitness of populations of different sizes
3) We need to incorporate memory into animal movement
4) The mixing rate (rate at which individuals mix with individuals of the same species or of different species) influences the level of resolution at which we can separate the influence of heterogeneity and intra/interspecific interaction on the population dynamics.
CONCLUSION
Knowing how individual moovements affect population moovements can improve our understanding of population dynamics. Moovements of individual in populations is important to understand how individuals and different populations get mixed. We should also try to understand how different environmental conditions affect moovement. It might be that the new technologies will allow this. Hower, this was written 10 years ago. I should look for new papers.

abstract = {Gibbons are among the best-studied Asian primates, but few studies address their demography and life history strategies. We used annual censuses to study the demography of agile gibbons (Hylobates agilis) between 1998 and 2009 in rain forests of Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, Indonesia. The population declined from 22 individuals (9 groups) to 14 individuals (5 groups) over the 12 yr of study. Infant survival to the juvenile age class was 33.3{\%}, and 16.7{\%} of infants survived to the subadult age class. The interbirth interval was 3.83±1.15 yr and birth rate was 0.22–0.28 infants female–1 yr–1. Two groups colonized the study area but subsequently disappeared.We documented 7 immigrations, 17 disappearances, and ≥10 transients in the population. Compared to lar gibbons (Hylobates lar) and Bornean white-bearded gibbons (Hylobates albibarbis), Way Canguk's agile gibbon population is characterized by slow reproduction, low survival, and high group turnover. We hypothesize that, although the habitat is high in fruit resources, agile gibbons may be displaced or excluded from the best fruit resources by larger and more numerous competitors, incurring costs of decreased opportunities to forage and increased travel, and leading to higher mortality for young agile gibbons. The reproductive potential of this agile gibbon population is insufficient to compensate for high mortality, and the population is unlikely to persist without immigration from outside the area. Given the agile gibbons' endangered status and limited capacity to respond demographically to change, it is likely that intensive management interventions will be required to conserve this species},

abstract = {Lakes systems respond physically, chemically and biologically to changes in climate and these responses are registered in many various ways in lake sediment records. This paper focuses principally on the biological record and describes recent research that aims to reconstruct (i) past variability in effective moisture, and (ii) past variability in temperature. Changes in effective moisture are manifested especially by changes in lake water level. In closed lake basins water level change can cause significant changes in water salinity that is registered in sediments by changes in the composition of fossil assemblages, especially diatoms. In open (freshwater) lake basins changes in water level are best reconstructed from the aquatic macrofossil record and potentially from the ratio of open water to littoral species of Cladocera, ostracods and diatoms. The most promising biological method for reconstructing past temperature is chironomid analysis, and a range of new chironomid-temperature transfer functions are being developed. However, biological responses to changing temperature are usually indirect as a result of temperature effects on water-column stratification, nutrient cycling and alkalinity generation, and in most cases a correct interpretation of the climatic significance of changes in the fossil record requires an understanding of the processes that are operating in the water column. A multi-proxy, whole-lake approach is advocated as the best way forward, not only as a means of reconstructing past climate but also as a means of assessing the impact of climate change on lake systems.},

The concept of the ecological niche relates a set of environmental variables to the fitness of species, while habitat suitability models (HSMs) relate environmental variables to the likelihood of occurrence of the species. In spite of this relationship, the concepts are weakly linked in the literature, and there is a strong need for better integration. 2. We selectively reviewed the literature for habitat suitability studies that directly addressed four common facets of niche theory: niche characteristics, niche interactions, community-wide processes and niche evolution. 3. We found that HSMs have mostly contributed to the study of niche characteristics, but the three other themes are gaining impetus. We discuss three issues that emerge from these studies: (i) commonly used environmental variables and their link with ecological niches; (ii) the causes of false absences and false presences in species data, and associated issues; (iii) the three axes of model generalization (interpolation and extrapolation): environmental, spatial and temporal. Finally, we propose a list of 12 recommendations to strengthen the use of HSMs for wildlife management. 4. Synthesis and applications. This selective review provides conservation biologists with a list of pointers to key niche-theory concepts and a wide palette of related HSM studies. It also brings together frameworks that are often separated: theoretical and applied ecology studies; botany, zoology and parasitology; and different HSM frameworks, such as Resource Selection Functions, Species Distribution Modelling, Ecological Niche Modelling, and Gradient Analysis. We hope that integration of all these slices of knowledge will improve the quality and reliability of HSM predictions. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

abstract = {The oceanographic and coastal features of the British Isles provide a wealth of ideal habitats for breeding seabirds and it is no surprise that the British and Irish seabird populations are of international importance, both in sheer numbers and in species diversity. Indeed, for some species British waters are host to the greater part of the world's population. This book presents the most up-to-date information available on these seabird populations, their numbers and distribution, and their changing fortunes in recent years. The Operation Seafarer survey, carried out in 1969-70, provided a baseline for future work that led to the establishment of the Seabird Colony Register by the Seabird Group and the Nature Conservancy Council. The results and analysis of their counts during 1985-87 form the basis for this book. Improved census methodology and a new computerised database has set *the standards for seabird monitoring in future decades. In Part 1 the general biology and population trends of British seabirds are described to set the scene for Part 2, in which the results and analysis for each of the 24 breeding species are given in detail. Full descriptions of the counting methods and the estimating factors used provide guidelines for future surveys not only in Britain, but wherever seabirds are of interest and importance. No-one with an interest in seabirds or conservation can afford to be without this authoritative book, nor but be grateful to the small army of professionals and amateurs who have so ably explored our coastal habitats.

abstract = {The main drivers of global environmental change (CO2 enrichment, nitrogen deposition, climate, biotic invasions and land use) cause extinctions and alter species distributions, and recent evidence shows that they exert pervasive impacts on various antagonistic and mutualistic interactions among species. In this review, we synthesize data from 688 published studies to show that these drivers often alter competitive interactions among plants and animals, exert multitrophic effects on the decomposer food web, increase intensity of pathogen infection, weaken mutualisms involving plants, and enhance herbivory while having variable effects on predation. A recurrent finding is that there is substantial variability among studies in both the magnitude and direction of effects of any given GEC driver on any given type of biotic interaction. Further, we show that higher order effects among multiple drivers acting simultaneously create challenges in predicting future responses to global environmental change, and that extrapolating these complex impacts across entire networks of species interactions yields unanticipated effects on ecosystems. Finally, we conclude that in order to reliably predict the effects of GEC on community and ecosystem processes, the greatest single challenge will be to determine how biotic and abiotic context alters the direction and magnitude of GEC effects on biotic interactions. {\textcopyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {A growing body of literature seeks to explain variation in range shifts using species' ecological and life-history traits, with expectations that shifts should be greater in species with greater dispersal ability, reproductive potential, and ecological generalization. Despite strong theoretical support for species' traits as predictors of range shifts, empirical evidence from contemporary range shift studies remains limited in extent and consensus. We conducted the first comprehensive review of species' traits as predictors of range shifts, collecting results from 51 studies across multiple taxa encompassing over 11,000 species' responses for 54 assemblages of taxonomically related species occurring together in space. We used studies of assemblages that directly compared geographic distributions sampled in the 20th century prior to climate change with resurveys of distributions after contemporary climate change and then tested whether species traits accounted for heterogeneity in range shifts. We performed a formal meta-analysis on study-level effects of body size, fecundity, diet breadth, habitat breadth, and historic range limit as predictors of range shifts for a subset of 21 studies of 26 assemblages with sufficient data. Range shifts were consistent with predictions based on habitat breadth and historic range limit. However, body size, fecundity, and diet breadth showed no significant effect on range shifts across studies, and multiple studies reported significant relationships that contradicted predictions. Current understanding of species' traits as predictors of range shifts is limited, and standardized study is needed for traits to be valid indicators of vulnerability in assessments of climate change impacts.},

abstract = {Understanding which species might become extinct and the consequences of such loss is critical. One consequence is a cascade of further, secondary extinctions. While a significant amount is known about the types of communities and species that suffer secondary extinctions, little is known about the consequences of secondary extinctions for biodiversity. Here we examine the effect of these secondary extinctions on trophic diversity, the range of trophic roles played by the species in a community. Our analyses of natural and model food webs show that secondary extinctions cause loss of trophic diversity greater than that expected from chance, a result that is robust to variation in food web structure, distribution of interactions strengths, functional response, and adaptive foraging. Greater than expected loss of trophic diversity occurs because more trophically unique species are more vulnerable to secondary extinction. This is not a straightforward consequence of these species having few links with others but is a complex function of how direct and indirect interactions affect species persistence. A positive correlation between a species' extinction probability and the importance of its loss defines high-risk species and should make their conservation a priority. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The University of Chicago.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The degree to which loud-calls in nonhuman primates can be used as a reliable taxonomic tool is the subject of ongoing debate. A recent study on crested gibbons showed that these species can be well distinguished by their songs; even at the population level the authors found reliable differences. Although there are some further studies on geographic and phylogenetic differences in loud-calls of nonhuman primate species, it is unclear to what extent loud-calls of other species have a similar close relation between acoustic structure, phylogenetic relatedness and geographic distance. We therefore conducted a field survey in 19 locations on Sumatra, Java and the Mentawai islands to record male loud-calls of wild surilis (Presbytis), a genus of Asian leaf monkeys (Colobinae) with disputed taxanomy, and compared the structure of their loud-calls with a molecular genetic analysis. RESULTS: The acoustic analysis of 100 surili male loud-calls from 68 wild animals confirms the differentiation of P.potenziani, P.comata, P.thomasi and P.melalophos. In a more detailed acoustic analysis of subspecies of P.melalophos, a further separation of the southern P.m.mitrata confirms the proposed paraphyly of this group. In concordance with their geographic distribution we found the highest correlation between call structure and genetic similarity, and lesser significant correlations between call structure and geographic distance, and genetic similarity and geographic distance. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we show, that as in crested gibbons, the acoustic structure of surili loud-calls is a reliable tool to distinguish between species and to verify phylogenetic relatedness and migration backgrounds of respective taxa. Since vocal production in other nonhuman primates show similar constraints, it is likely that an acoustic analysis of call structure can help to clarify taxonomic and phylogenetic relationships.},

Such a shifting mosaic is thought to have profound implications for the persistence and stability of ecosystems. Management and conservation of natural systems would be enhanced if we could accurately predict movement. Such prediction has not yet been possible. Here we use an extensive set of field data on food abundance and quality, combined with experimentally derived measures of nutritional value, to predict the spatial distribution of Thomson's gazelles (Gazella thomsoni thomsoni G{\"{u}}nter) on the Serengeti Plains of East Africa. Twelve plausible models, based on alternate foraging objectives or movement rules, were assessed against field data on food and grazer abundance gathered at biweekly intervals (every two weeks) over the course of the wet seasons in two different years. Nomadic movements of gazelles closely tracked changes in the spatial distribution of short grass swards. Gazelles left short grass patches when local daily energy intake dropped below the expected intake averaged across the landscape. Subsequent redistribution of gazelles among neighboring patches was proportional to daily rates of energy intake in each patch. Thus, nomadic movements by Thomson's gazelles were predictable on the basis of local energy gain. This suggests that adaptive behavioral models can provide useful predictive tools for understanding the dynamics of complex natural systems.},

abstract = {Introduction Interspecific interactions in ecological communities are the main mechanisms that determine structure, functioning, and stability of ecosystems (May, 1972, 1973; Neutel et al., 2002; Alessina and Tang, 2012; Mougi and Kondoh, 2012, 2014). These interactions can be qualitatively positive, negative, or neutral, and pairs of these interactions between two species may be of opposite sign (e.g., trophic, parasitic) or of equivalent sign (e.g., mutualistic, competitive). Most of the research on ecological interactions has focused on feeding relations (Odum, 1971; Pimm, 1982; Levin et al., 2009; McCann, 2011; Moore and de Ruiter, 2012), but in recent studies of ecological communities this was extended to parasitic (Huxham et al., 1995; Thompson et al., 2004; Lafferty et al., 2006; Kuris et al., 2008) and non-parasitic non-trophic relations (Thebault and Fountaine, 2010; Fontaine et al., 2011; K{\'{e}}fi et al., 2012; Mougi and Kondoh, 2012; Sauve et al., 2014). In this chapter, we focus on parasitic relations and notably on the question of how trophic interactions and infectious agents mutually influence each other. Here we will refer to the combined classes of infectious species as parasites (see next section for details). The impact of parasites in an ecological community can be quantified through their direct influence on the food-web structure, as well as more indirectly through the way they influence physiological traits of host species and trophic relations of the host and non-host species (K{\'{e}}fi et al., 2012; Selakovic et al., 2014). In this chapter we first briefly discuss the diversity of parasitic interactions, their relationships with host and non-host species, as well as their effects on a simple consumer–resource relationship consisting of one host and one non-host species. The largest part of the chapter is devoted to exploring a basic model, to show how intricately ecological and epidemiological effects are interwoven, even in the simplest possible ecosystem consisting of two species. Even though this model is basic in the sense that it is low dimensional and not meant to realistically represent any particular system, the analysis does hint at broader ecological insight, for example into possible differences between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems based on parasitic interaction. The simple analysis highlights the need to study the link between ecology and infectious disease epidemiology in more realistic models.},

abstract = {Species loss can result in secondary extinctions and changes in ecosystem functions at distant trophic levels. Such effects of species loss are predicted to be affected by both the number of species lost within a trophic level (horizontal diversity) and the number of trophic levels lost (vertical diversity). We experimentally manipulated horizontal and vertical diversity within an aquatic insect community, and examined responses throughout the food web. Horizontal and vertical diversity both impacted ciliates: reduction of detritivorous insect diversity resulted in secondary extinctions and decreased density of ciliates, but only when an insect predator was simultaneously absent. Horizontal and vertical diversity differed in their effect on other foodweb processes, including detrital processing, predator growth, and densities of rotifers, flagellates and flatworms.

abstract = {Climate change may disrupt interspecies phenological synchrony, with adverse consequences to ecosystem functioning. We present here a 40-y-long time series on 10,425 dates that were systematically collected in a single Russian locality for 97 plant, 78 bird, 10 herptile, 19 insect, and 9 fungal phenological events, as well as for 77 climatic events related to temperature, precipitation, snow, ice, and frost. We show that species are shifting their phenologies at dissimilar rates, partly because they respond to different climatic factors, which in turn are shifting at dissimilar rates. Plants have advanced their spring phenology even faster than average temperature has increased, whereas migratory birds have shown more divergent responses and shifted, on average, less than plants. Phenological events of birds and insects were mainly triggered by climate cues (variation in temperature and snow and ice cover) occurring over the course of short periods, whereas many plants, herptiles, and fungi were affected by long-term climatic averages. Year-to-year variation in plants, herptiles, and insects showed a high degree of synchrony, whereas the phenological timing of fungi did not correlate with any other taxonomic group. In many cases, species that are synchronous in their year-to-year dynamics have also shifted in congruence, suggesting that climate change may have disrupted phenological synchrony less than has been previously assumed. Our results illustrate how a multidimensional change in the physical environment has translated into a community-level change in phenology.},

abstract = {Ecosystems host multiple coexisting predator species whose interactions may strengthen or weaken top–down control of grazers. Grazer populations often exhibit size-structure, but the nature of multiple predator effects on suppression of size-structured prey has seldom been explicitly considered. In a southeastern US salt-marsh, we used both field (additive design) and mesocosm (additive-substitutive design) experiments to test the independent and combined effects of two species of predatory crab on the survival and predator-avoidance behavior (i.e. a non-consumptive effect) of both juveniles and adults of a dominant grazing snail. Results showed: 1) juvenile snails were more vulnerable to predation; 2) consumptive impacts of predators were hierarchically nested, i.e. the larger predator consumed both juvenile and adult snails, while the smaller-bodied predator consumed only juvenile snails; 3) there were no emergent multiple predator effects on snail consumption; and 4) non-consumptive effects differed from consumptive effects, with only the large predator inducing predator-avoidance behavior of individuals within either snail ontogenetic class. The smaller predator therefore played a functionally redundant trophic role across the prey classes considered, augmenting and potentially stabilizing trophic regulation of juvenile snails. Meanwhile, the larger predator played a complementary and functionally unique role by both expanding the size-spectrum of prey trophic regulation and non-consumptively altering prey behavior. While our study suggests that nestedness of consumptive interactions determined by predator and prey body sizes may allow prediction of the functional redundancy of particular predator species, it also shows that traits beyond predator body size (e.g. habitat domain) may be required to predict potentially cascading non-consumptive effects. Future studies of multiple predators (and predator biodiversity) should continue to strive towards greater realism by incorporating not only size-structured prey, but also other aspects of resource and environmental heterogeneity typical of natural ecosystems.},

abstract = {Introduction Although the ubiquitous biodiversity-related flexibility of ecological systems is qualitatively well established, most empirical and theoretical studies regard ecological systems so far as units with rigid, predefined properties. The reason for this static approach is that incorporating the tremendous diversity and flexibility of natural systems into empirical and theoretical studies has been extremely challenging in terms of developing consistent mathematical frameworks and designing appropriate experiments. This approach has also been necessary owing to the lack of empirical data on the ability of species to change properties over time. A recent approach to solve this problem is to move from a species- to a trait-based perspective. This is not just a change in terminology but in concept, providing a mechanistic basis for biodiversity–ecosystem function relationships and improving our potential to identify general rules in community ecology (McGill et al., 2006; Savage et al., 2007; Hillebrand and Matthiessen, 2009). Functional traits are used to link species to their function in the ecosystem. They are well defined, measurable properties of individuals (e.g., edibility or diet selectivity) affecting their performance and responses to environmental changes and hence population and community dynamics as well as trophic interactions. The frequency distribution of functional traits (Figure 10.1a) enables a quantification of functional diversity. Large variation in trait values (e.g., a full range from highly edible, fast growing to almost inedible, slow growing species) implies a high functional diversity and vice versa. This trait distribution may be described by its shape and central tendency (Figure 10.1b) and may change in response to altered abiotic (e.g., temperature) and biotic conditions (e.g., predator density) and thus characterize the milieu with which individual organisms interact (McGill et al., 2006) (Figure 10.1c). Scientific Background Maintaining the different kinds of ecosystem services in a way that optimizes human well-being and economy is one of the most urgent tasks of our century, which challenges policy-makers as well as scientists. The frequency and intensity of land use, climate change, and other anthropogenically induced environmental disturbances are accelerating biodiversity declines worldwide. The negative impact of these processes on ecological systems (e.g., individuals, populations, communities, and food webs) may amplify each other: environmental changes can accelerate biodiversity loss and a reduced biodiversity may increase the sensitivity of ecological systems to environmental changes.},

Here, we propose a means for quantifying functional diversity that may be particularly useful for determining how functional diversity is related to ecosystem functioning. This measure of functional diversity ''FD'' is defined as the total branch length of a functional dendrogram. Various characteristics of FD make it preferable to other measures of functional diversity, such as the number of functional groups in a community. Simulating species' trait values illustrates how the relative importance of richness and composition for FD depends on the effective dimensionality of the trait space in which species separate. Fewer dimensions increase the importance of community composition and functional redundancy. More dimensions increase the importance of species richness and decreases functional redundancy. Clumping of species in trait space increases the relative importance of community composition. Five natural communities show remarkably similar relationships between FD and species richness.},

abstract = {The ubiquity of modular structure in real-world complex networks is the focus of attention in many trials to understand the interplay between network topology and functionality. The best approaches to the identification of modular structure are based on the optimization of a quality function known as modularity. However this optimization is a hard task provided that the computational complexity of the problem is in the non-deterministic polynomial time hard (NP-hard) class. Here we propose an exact method for reducing the size of weighted (directed and undirected) complex networks while maintaining their modularity. This size reduction allows use of heuristic algorithms that optimize modularity for a better exploration of the modularity landscape. We compare the modularity obtained in several real complex-networks by using the extremal optimization algorithm, before and after the size reduction, showing the improvement obtained. We speculate that the proposed analytical size reduction could be extended to an exact coarse graining of the network in the scope of real-space renormalization. {\textcopyright} IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

Proper assessment of the flora will allow reintroduction programmes to determine whether the area will be capable of supporting the released animals in the long-term. Here data are presented from an island in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia which has been used as a release site for agile gibbons (Hylobates agilis albibarbis) since January 2003. RESULTS: Methods and results regarding fruit abundance, fruit productivity, tree density and diversity are presented. This information is then analysed in the context of the island's suitability to sustain released gibbons and without impact on the resident fauna. Based on the above ecological characteristics, the final carrying capacity of the island is estimated to be between 3 and 19 gibbons. CONCLUSION: These data highlight the need to survey areas being considered for release of gibbon prior to the release taking place. For reintroductions to be successful, long-term habitat assessment is vital, both pre- and post-release.},

abstract = {Network approaches to ecological questions have been increasingly used, particularly in recent decades. The abstraction of ecological systems – such as communities – through networks of interactions between their components indeed provides a way to summarize this information with single objects. The methodological framework derived from graph theory also provides numerous approaches and measures to analyze these objects and can offer new perspectives on established ecological theories as well as tools to address new challenges. However, prior to using these methods to test ecological hypotheses, it is necessary that we understand, adapt, and use them in ways that both allow us to deliver their full potential and account for their limitations. Here, we attempt to increase the accessibility of network approaches by providing a review of the tools that have been developed so far, with – what we believe to be – their appropriate uses and potential limitations. This is not an exhaustive review of all methods and metrics, but rather, an overview of tools that are robust, informative, and ecologically sound. After providing a brief presentation of species interaction networks and how to build them in order to summarize ecological information of different types, we then classify methods and metrics by the types of ecological questions that they can be used to answer from global to local scales, including methods for hypothesis testing and future perspectives. Specifically, we show how the organization of species interactions in a community yields different network structures (e.g., more or less dense, modular or nested), how different measures can be used to describe and quantify these emerging structures, and how to compare communities based on these differences in structures. Within networks, we illustrate metrics that can be used to describe and compare the functional and dynamic roles of species based on their position in the network and the organization of their interactions as well as associated new methods to test the significance of these results. Lastly, we describe potential fruitful avenues for new methodological developments to address novel ecological questions.},

We analyzed mitochondrial DNA sequences of cytochrome b (Cyt b) and 12S rRNA to determine the phylogenetic relationships of the genus Presbytis. Gene fragments of 388 and 371 bp of Cyt b and 12S rRNA, respectively, were sequenced from samples of Presbytis melalophos (subspecies femoralis, siamensis, robinsoni, and chrysomelas), P. rubicunda and P. hosei. The genus Trachypithecus (Cercopithecidae) was used as an outgroup. The Cyt b NJ and MP phylogeny trees showed P. m. chrysomelas to be the most primitive, followed by P. hosei, whereas 12S rRNA tree topology only indicated that these two species have close relationships with the other members of the genus. In our analysis, chrysomelas, previously classified as a subspecies of P. melalophos, was not included in either the P. m. femoralis clade or the P. m. siamensis clade. Whether or not there should be a separation at the species level remains to be clarified. The tree topologies also showed that P. m. siamensis is paraphyletic with P. m. robinsoni, and P. m. femoralis with P. rubicunda, in two different clades. Cyt b and 12S rRNA are good gene candidates for the study of phylogenetic relationships at the species level. However, the systematic relationships of some subspecies in this genus remain unclear.},

Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate data sets. Non-parametric methods, based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper describes a new non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after McArdle and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for ANOVA (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description provided by McArdle and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The test-statistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher's F-ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. P-values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.},

abstract = {Human impacts are dramatically altering our natural ecosystems but the exact repercussions on ecological sustainability and function remain unclear. As a result, food web theory has experienced a proliferation of research seeking to address these critical areas. Arguing that the various recent and classical food web theories can be looked at collectively and in a highly consistent and testable way, Food Webs synthesizes and reconciles modern and classical perspectives into a general unified theory. Kevin McCann brings together outcomes from population-, community-, and ecosystem-level approaches under the common currency of energy or material fluxes. He shows that these approaches--often studied in isolation--all have the same general implications in terms of population dynamic stability. Specifically, increased fluxes of energy or material tend to destabilize populations, communities, and whole ecosystems. With this understanding, stabilizing structures at different levels of the ecological hierarchy can be identified and any population-, community-, or ecosystem-level structures that mute energy or material flow also stabilize systems dynamics. McCann uses this powerful general framework to discuss the effects of human impact on the stability and sustainability of ecological systems, and he demonstrates that there is clear empirical evidence that the structures supporting ecological systems have been dangerously eroded. Uniting the latest research on food webs with classical theories, this book will be a standard source in the understanding of natural food web functions.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Questions: Is there a shift from positive to negative biotic interaction effects on seedling recruitment along two different stress gradients, temperature and precipitation (the stress-gradient hypothesis); do such interaction effects differ between species with different bioclimatic affinities?. Location: Boreal, sub-alpine and alpine grassland in southern Norway. Methods: We tested the stress-gradient hypothesis by comparing seedling recruitment in bare-ground gaps where vegetation has been removed vs in extant grassland vegetation in 12 boreal, sub-alpine and alpine grassland sites along a precipitation gradient. This was tested in (1) a seed-sowing experiment and (2) in naturally occurring recruitment of alpine, generalist and boreal species. Results: Emergence of the sown alpine species was higher in the cold alpine than in the warmer sub-alpine sites, with no effects of precipitation or vegetation removal. The sown generalists also decreased in emergence towards warmer sites, whereas there was no effect of temperature on the sown boreal species. Vegetation removal, interacting with precipitation, increased the emergence of the generalist and boreal species sown at intermediate precipitation levels. In contrast, interactions between temperature and vegetation removal regulated the emergence of all groups of naturally occurring seedlings. Alpine and generalist species emerged at the highest rate in alpine sites, whereas boreal species had highest emergence in the lowlands. Conclusion: For all species groups, strong effects of vegetation removal show that competition from the extant vegetation dominates in controlling seedling emergence across all study sites and species. In generalist and boreal species, positive interactions between vegetation removal and temperature show that competitive interactions affect seedling emergence more strongly towards warmer climates, in line with the stress-gradient hypothesis. In contrast, alpine species show no such interactions. This suggests that species' adaptations to climate, in combination with environmental forcing, control seedling emergence along the bioclimatic gradients. Our results have implications for nature conservation, as we propose that disturbance from grazing animals can be useful to release competition and thereby increase seedling recruitment and biodiversity in boreal and alpine grasslands in a warmer future.},

abstract = {Biotic interactions present a challenge in determining whether species distributions will track climate change. Interactions with competitors, consumers, mutualists, and facilitators can strongly influence local species distributions, but few studies assess how and whether these interactions will impede or accelerate climate change-induced range shifts. In this paper, we explore how ecologists might move forward on this question. We first outline the conditions under which biotic interactions can result in range shifts that proceed faster or slower than climate velocity and result in ecological surprises. Next, we use our own work to demonstrate that experimental studies documenting the strength of biotic interactions across large environmental gradients are a critical first step for understanding whether they will influence climate change-induced range shifts. Further progress could be made by integrating results from these studies into modeling frameworks to predict how or generalize when biotic interactions mediate how changing climates influence range shifts. Finally, we argue that many more case studies like those described here are needed to explore the importance of biotic interactions during climate change-induced range shifts. {\textcopyright} 2013 New York Academy of Sciences.},

abstract = {When compared with nearby vegetated areas, seagrass meadows contain a dense and strikingly rich assemblage of vertebrates and invertebrates. Most recent literature has focused on evaluating the role of predation in structuring seagrass faunal communities; however, habitat complexity, abundance of food and sediment stability may also be important. This paper summarizes studies relating predator-prey relationships to different features of the seagrass system. This review suggests that the abundance of many species, both epifauna and infauna, is positively correlated with two distinct aspects of plant morphology: 1) the root-rhizome mat, and 2) plant canopy. A scheme was developed that defines the conditions under which any particular species will be abundant or rare in a seagrass assemblage. This scheme is based on prey and predator characteristics (e.g., epifaunal vs. infaunal, tube-dweller vs. nontube dweller, burrowers vs. nonburrowers, and large vs. small as adult) and on characteristics of the seagrasses (e.g., leaf morphology, shoot density, shoot biomass, structural complexity of the meadow, and root-rhizome density and standing crop).},

abstract = {There is growing recognition of urban areas as hosts for innovative ways to conserve and promote biodiversity. Parks, as one specific type of urban green space, constitute particularly important biodiversity hotspots in the cityscape. We reviewed empirical findings on the species richness in urban parks across all species groups that have been studied. The aim was to assess and discuss the overall species richness of urban parks, its community attributes and drivers. Search and subsequent selection process resulted in 62 papers from 25 different countries. For all examined species groups, the findings consistently show that parks are among the most species rich types of urban green spaces, but also that exotics constitute large shares, especially of plant species. Key ecological theories like the gradient approach and the island habitat ecological theory, and fundamental ecological relationships such as the species-area relationship are valid despite the manipulated 'nature' of parks and the surrounding urban matrix. Most studies surveyed large number of parks and applied 'multi-scale' approaches in tests of confounding variables, providing methodological strength. While matrix effects are consistently found to affect species richness negatively, the diversity of habitats and microhabitat heterogeneity contained in urban parks appears as the most decisive factor for the overall species richness. However, a constraint of research to date is the limitation of individual studies to one or a few species groups, rarely bridging between flora and fauna. Adopting 'multi-species group' approaches in future research is needed to further advance the understanding of the overall biodiversity of urban parks, and its drivers.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

This paper focuses on the potential of demand response in balancing supply and demand on an hourly basis. Using the WILMAR model, various levels and prices of demand response were simulated. Results indicate that demand response has the potential to smooth overall power system operation, with production cost savings arising from both improved thermal power plant operations and increased wind production.

abstract = {Key message: Tree growth shows a non-linear response to temperature. Under climate change, this leads to a consistent increase of high basal area increments only at the highest elevations. Abstract: Forest dynamics and particularly tree growth rates are considerably affected by temperature. Hence, global warming is expected to have large impacts on the growth and distribution of trees, especially at the cold distribution limit. While the influence of interannual temperature variability on tree growth has been described intensely, only few studies have analyzed how growth rates of trees decline along a fine-scale temperature gradient close to treeline. We compiled temporally and spatially highly resolved long-term air and soil temperature variables (degree-day sum, growing season length, and growing season mean temperature) at three study sites comprising nine elevation gradients in the Swiss Alps. These temperature variables were paired with basal area increment data of the four major treeline species growing along these transects. Close to treeline, basal area increment of all species depended primarily on degree-day sums or growing season length, rather than on growing season mean temperature. While basal area increment was best explained by combining air temperature of the current and previous growing seasons, the importance of soil temperature for tree growth was site-specific. When moving down from upper treeline, the temperature–growth relationship was strongly non-linear, showing a rapid decrease of temperature limitation and an increasing importance of factors other than temperature. Over the last 50 years, temperatures have increased substantially at all sites, with isotherms moving upward 160–260 m in elevation. The threshold dependence of growth to temperature that we identified has led to an increase of high basal area increments over time, which, however, was consistent throughout the population only at the highest elevations.},

abstract = {Climate change will redistribute the global biodiversity in the Anthropocene. As climates change, species might move from one place to another, due to local extinctions and colonization of new environments. However, the existence of permeable migratory routes precedes faunal migrations in fragmented landscapes. Here, we investigate how dispersal will affect the outcome of climate change on the distribution of Amazon's primate species. We modeled the distribution of 80 Amazon primate species, using ecological niche models, and projected their potential distribution on scenarios of climate change. Then, we imposed landscape restrictions to primate dispersal, derived from a natural biogeographical barrier to primates (the main tributaries of the Amazon river) and an anthropogenic constraint to the migration of many canopy-dependent animals (deforested areas). We also highlighted potential conflict zones, i.e. regions of high migration potential but predicted to be deforested. Species response to climate change varied across dispersal limitation scenarios. If species could occupy all newly suitable climate, almost 70{\%} of species could expand ranges. Including dispersal barriers (natural and anthropogenic), however, led to range expansion in only less than 20{\%} of the studied species. When species were not allowed to migrate, all of them lost an average of 90{\%} of the suitable area, suggesting that climate may become unsuitable within their present distributions. All Amazon primate species may need to move as climate changes to avoid deleterious effects of exposure to non-analog climates. The effect of climate change on the distribution of Amazon primates will ultimately depend on whether landscape permeability will allow climate-driven faunal migrations. The network of protected areas in the Amazon could work as ‘stepping stones' but most are outside important migratory routes. Therefore, protecting important dispersal corridors is foremost to allow effective migrations of the Amazon fauna in face of climate change and deforestation.},

Here, we explore variation of dietary niche breadth across land birds occurring in Eastern Germany in correlation with phylogeny and traits like distributional range size, abundance, habitat range, body size, migratory behaviour and sexual dimorphism. First, we found a clear indication of phylogenetic conservatism: about half of the variation in dietary niche breadth across species was due to variation between families and genera. Habitat range, distributional range size of species in Eastern Germany and abundance did not correlate with dietary niche breadth. The significance of the correlation of dietary niche breadth with body size, distributional range size of species in Europe and plumage dichromatism depends on the details of the analyses. Nevertheless, even after controlling for phylogeny, we found robust correlations of dietary niche breadth versus migratory behaviour as well as sexual size dimorphism: species with a narrow dietary niche tend to be migratory and, in species with a broad dietary niche, males tend to be larger than females.},

abstract = {Remnant natural areas within urban settings can act as important refuges for wildlife, substantially increasing local biodiversity. However, habitat suitability for these species is potentially affected by human recreational activities including the presence of free-running dogs. To compare the diversity and abundance of songbird and small mammal communities between areas with bylaws that require, or do not require, dogs to be leashed, point counts and live-trapping surveys were conducted in three habitat types (deciduous, coniferous, and meadow) in the river valley parks of Edmonton, Alberta. Among birds, there was no difference between areas with different leashing bylaws in species diversity for any of the three habitat types. Similarly, there was no difference in bird diversity for a subset of species that were plausibly breeding at these sites. However, higher bird diversity was recorded in deciduous and coniferous sites than in meadow sites, regardless of leash des- ignation, probably as a function of the horticultural practice of mowing meadows. Among both birds and small mammals, there was no difference in the abundance of individuals as a function of leashing bylaws. Our results suggest that off-leash dogs have no effect on the diversity or abundance of birds and small mammals in urban parks, but it is also possible that other factors, such as leash law compliance, reduced or obscured the effects of off-leash dogs in this study.},

abstract = {Human-induced alterations in the birth and mortality rates of species and in the strength of interactions within and between species can lead to changes in the structure and resilience of ecological communities. Recent research points to the importance of considering the distribution of body sizes of species when exploring the response of communities to such perturbations. Here, we present a new size-based approach for assessing the sensitivity and elasticity of community structure (species equilibrium abundances) and resilience (rate of return to equilibrium) to changes in the intrinsic growth rate of species and in the strengths of species interactions. We apply this approach on two natural systems, the pelagic communities of the Baltic Sea and Lake V{\"{a}}ttern, to illustrate how it can be used to identify potential keystone species and keystone links. We find that the keystone status of a species is closely linked to its body size. The analysis also suggests that communities are structurally and dynamically more sensitive to changes in the effects of prey on their consumers than in the effects of consumers on their prey. Moreover, we discuss how community sensitivity analysis can be used to study and compare the fragility of communities with different body size distributions by measuring the mean sensitivity or elasticity over all species or all interaction links in a community. We believe that the community sensitivity analysis developed here holds some promise for identifying species and links that are critical for the structural and dynamic robustness of ecological communities. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.},

Movement research is both plentiful and insightful, and recent methodological advances facilitate obtaining a detailed view of individual movement. Yet, we lack a general unifying paradigm, derived from first principles, which can place movement studies within a common context and advance the development of a mature scientific discipline. This introductory article to the Movement Ecology Special Feature proposes a paradigm that integrates conceptual, theoretical, methodological, and empirical frameworks for studying movement of all organisms, from microbes to trees to elephants. We introduce a conceptual framework depicting the interplay among four basic mechanistic components of organismal movement: the internal state (why move?), motion (how to move?), and navigation (when and where to move?) capacities of the individual and the external factors affecting movement. We demonstrate how the proposed framework aids the study of various taxa and movement types; promotes the formulation of hypotheses about movement; and complements existing biomechanical, cognitive, random, and optimality para- digms of movement. The proposed framework integrates eclectic research on movement into a structured paradigm and aims at pro- viding a basis for hypothesis generation and a vehicle facilitating the understanding of the causes, mechanisms, and spatiotemporal patterns of movement and their role in various ecological and evolutionary processes.},

abstract = {We assessed if the relative importance of biotic and abiotic factors for plant community composition differs along environmental gradients and between functional groups, and asked which implications this may have in a warmer and wetter future. The study location is a unique grid of sites spanning regional-scale temperature and precipitation gradients in boreal and alpine grasslands in southern Norway. Within each site we sampled vegetation and associated biotic and abiotic factors, and combined broad- And fine-scale ordination analyses to assess the relative explanatory power of these factors for species composition. Although the community responses to biotic and abiotic factors did not consistently change as predicted along the bioclimatic gradients, abiotic variables tended to explain a larger proportion of the variation in species composition towards colder sites, whereas biotic variables explained more towards warmer sites, supporting the stress gradient hypothesis. Significant interactions with precipitation suggest that biotic variables explained more towards wetter climates in the sub alpine and boreal sites, but more towards drier climates in the colder alpine. Thus, we predict that biotic interactions may become more important in alpine and boreal grasslands in a warmer future, although more winter precipitation may counteract this trend in oceanic alpine climates. Our results show that both local and regional scales analyses are needed to disentangle the local vegetation-environment relationships and their regional- scale drivers, and biotic interactions and precipitation must be included when predicting future species assemblages.},

abstract = {Ponds arising from groundwater in Cerrado of Central Brazil are oligotrophic but highly biodiverse environments. in this study, we used stable isotope ratios to test if there are variations in carbon and nitrogen acquisition by different primary food sources and if they are influenced by seasonality in a well-preserved pond. We hypothesized that periphyton is the main food source for macrophyte-associated fauna. We found that $\delta$13C, but not $\delta$15N, can distinguish between primary food sources; however, the isotopic signatures of food sources did not differ significantly between seasons. The $\delta$15N values of macrophyte-associated fauna were significantly higher for predators compared with other trophic groups, but $\delta$13C values did not differ significantly between groups. Emergent macrophytes and periphyton were the main food sources for scrapers (contribution of 42.5{\%}) and collector-gatherers (contribution of 41.6{\%}), respectively. Compared with emergent macrophytes, submerged macrophytes were associated with a greater abundance of fauna and algal biomass but were not a significant food source for associated fauna. our findings demonstrate that in this small shallow oligotrophic pond in the Cerrado, the stable isotope ratios of carbon and nitrogen of food sources did not vary between seasons but did differ between aquatic macrophyte life forms. We point out the different functional roles of macrophyte life forms, with emergent macrophytes serving as an important food resource, while submerged macrophytes mainly provide physical structure se only.},

abstract = {Understanding and predicting species extinctions and coextinctions is a major goal of ecological research in the face of a biodiversity crisis. Typically, models based on network topology are used to simulate coextinctions in mutualistic networks. However, such topological models neglect two key biological features of species interactions: variation in the intrinsic dependence of species on the mutualism, and variation in the relative importance of each interacting partner. By incorporating both types of variation, we developed a stochastic coextinction model capable of simulating extinction cascades far more complex than those observed in previous topological models. Using a set of empirical mutualistic networks, we show that the traditional topological model may either underestimate or overestimate the number and likelihood of coextinctions, depending on the intrinsic dependence of species on the mutualism. More importantly, contrary to topological models, our stochastic model predicts extinction cascades to be more likely in highly connected mutualistic communities.},

abstract = {Intraspecific trophic variability has important ecological and evolutionary implications, and is driven by multiple interacting factors. Functional traits and environmental conditions are important in mediating the trophic niche of individuals because they determine their ability to consume certain prey, their energetic requirements, and resource availability. In this study, we aimed at investigating the interacting effects of functional traits and environmental conditions on several attributes of trophic niche in natural populations. Here, we quantified intraspecific variability in the trophic niche of 12 riverine populations of European minnow (Phoxinus phoxinus) using stable isotope analyses. Functional traits (i.e. morpho-anatomical traits) and environmental conditions (i.e. upstream–downstream gradient, forest cover) were quantified to identify the determinants of (1) trophic position and resource origin, (2) trophic niche size, and (3) trophic differentiation ($\beta$-diversity) among populations. We demonstrated that trophic position and resource origin covaried with functional traits related to body size and locomotion performance, and that the strength and shape of these relationships varied according to local environmental conditions. The trophic niche size also differed among populations, although no determinant was identified. Finally, trophic $\beta$-diversity was correlated to environmental differentiation among sites. Overall, the determinants of intraspecific variability in trophic niche appeared highly context-dependent, and related to the interactions between functional traits and environmental conditions. Because populations are currently facing important environmental changes, understanding this context-dependency is important for predicting food web structure and ecosystem dynamics in a changing world.},

abstract = {Summary: Biotic interactions are often expected to decrease in intensity as abiotic conditions become more stressful to organisms. However, in many cases, food-web and habitat complexity also change with abiotic stress or disturbance, potentially altering patterns of species interactions across environmental gradients. We used a combination of field assays and mesocosm experiments to investigate how disturbance from desiccation moderates top-down control of prey by predators across a gradient of pond duration in New Zealand. Field manipulations of predator abundance in ponds led to an unexpected decrease in the top-down control of prey biomass by predatory invertebrates as pond duration increased (decreasing abiotic stress). Predatory fish, which are restricted to permanent ponds, had negligible effects on prey biomass. Mesocosm experiments further indicated the consumptive effects of fish are weak; a result that cannot be explained by an increase in physical habitat refugia in relatively more permanent ponds. Manipulations of invertebrate predator diversity in mesocosms (both substitutive and additive treatments), and the addition of olfactory fish cues, revealed that strong non-consumptive effects of fish reduced predation by predatory invertebrates, and these effects overwhelmed the positive influence of invertebrate predator diversity on prey consumption. These results suggest that decreases in top-down control with increasing pond permanence are likely a result of non-consumptive effects of fish weakening predation by invertebrate predators in the more complex food webs of permanent ponds. Therefore, considering non-consumptive effects of predators in complex food webs will likely improve the understanding of biotic interactions across environmental gradients. {\textcopyright} 2013 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {Objective Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is a widely used reliability index in test-retest, intrarater, and interrater reliability analyses. This article introduces the basic concept of ICC in the content of reliability analysis. Discussion for Researchers There are 10 forms of ICCs. Because each form involves distinct assumptions in their calculation and will lead to different interpretations, researchers should explicitly specify the ICC form they used in their calculation. A thorough review of the research design is needed in selecting the appropriate form of ICC to evaluate reliability. The best practice of reporting ICC should include software information, “model,” “type,” and “definition” selections. Discussion for Readers When coming across an article that includes ICC, readers should first check whether information about the ICC form has been reported and if an appropriate ICC form was used. Based on the 95{\%} confident interval of the ICC estimate, values less than 0.5, between 0.5 and 0.75, between 0.75 and 0.9, and greater than 0.90 are indicative of poor, moderate, good, and excellent reliability, respectively. Conclusion This article provides a practical guideline for clinical researchers to choose the correct form of ICC and suggests the best practice of reporting ICC parameters in scientific publications. This article also gives readers an appreciation for what to look for when coming across ICC while reading an article.},

This study aimed to describe fluc-tuations in the local seahorse populations through month-ly surveys over a course of a year, in order to identify some of the potential drivers behind the seasonal fluctua-tions. A total of six sites were chosen based on their habitat characteristics. The highest H. guttulatus abun-dances were recorded at sites with higher holdfast avail-ability and depth ranging from 3 to 6 m, while H. hippo-campus were observed at highest numbers in sites with lower holdfast availability and patchy distribution. In most sites, seahorse density decreased during the summer months (from May to August) and increased from August to December. Holdfast use changed across the surveyed sites, according to the respective habitat characteristics. This study identified environmental variables that influ-enced the abundance of seahorse population, i.e., holdfast availability, depth and temperature in the Ria Formosa lagoon, underlining the importance of monitoring popu-lations over a course of no less than a year in order to avoid bias due to seasonal fluctuations. Identifying critical habitats will provide valuable information for local au-thorities in order to implement protective measures to-wards seahorse conservation.},

In Ria Formosa there are the biggest populations of seahorses ever recorded (Curtis {\&} Vincent, 2005). These are the population of the long-snout seahorse (Hippocampus guttulatus) and the short-snout seahorse (Hippocampus hippocampus). Seahorses (Genus: Hippocampus) are fishes that are threatened around the world, especially because of their thread for their use in traditional oriental medicine and as exotic species in aquariums (Vincent, 1996; Koldewey {\&} Martin-Smith, 2010). Because of this, all seahorses' species have been placed in the list of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Flora and Fauna (CITES) implemented in 2004. Multiple features make them vulnerable species to overfishing and habitat loss/damage. These include sparse distributions, low dispersal, small home ranges, low fecundity, lengthy parental care and mate fidelity (Foster {\&} Vincent, 2004).},

abstract = {Darwin's classic image of an "entangled bank" of interdependencies among species has long suggested that it is difficult to predict how the loss of one species affects the abundance of others. We show that for dynamical models of realistically structured ecological networks in which pair-wise consumer-resource interactions allometrically scale to the 3/4 power - as suggested by metabolic theory - the effect of losing one species on another can be predicted well by simple functions of variables easily observed in nature. By systematically removing individual species from 600 networks ranging from 10-30 species, we analyzed how the strength of 254,032 possible pair-wise species interactions depended on 90 stochastically varied species, link, and network attributes. We found that the interaction strength between a pair of species is predicted well by simple functions of the two species' biomasses and the body mass of the species removed. On average, prediction accuracy increases with network size, suggesting that greater web complexity simplifies predicting interaction strengths. Applied to field data, our model successfully predicts interactions dominated by trophic effects and illuminates the sign and magnitude of important nontrophic interactions. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Ecological networks are typically complex constructions of species and their interactions. During the last decade, the study of networks has moved from static to dynamic analyses, and has attained a deeper insight into their internal structure, heterogeneity, and temporal and spatial resolution. Here, we review, discuss and suggest research lines in the study of the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of networks and their hierarchical nature. We use case study data from two well-characterized model systems (the food web in Broadstone Stream in England and the pollination network at Zackenberg in Greenland), which are complemented with additional information from other studies. We focus upon eight topics: temporal dynamic space-for-time substitutions linkage constraints habitat borders network modularity individual-based networks invasions of networks and super networks that integrate different network types. Few studies have explicitly examined temporal change in networks, and we present examples that span from daily to decadal change: a common pattern that we see is a stable core surrounded by a group of dynamic, peripheral species, which, in pollinator networks enter the web via preferential linkage to the most generalist species. To some extent, temporal and spatial scales are interchangeable (i.e. networks exhibit 'ergodicity') and we explore how space-for-time substitutions can be used in the study of networks. Network structure is commonly constrained by phenological uncoupling (a temporal phenomenon), abundance, body size and population structure. Some potential links are never observed, that is they are 'forbidden' (fully constrained) or 'missing' (a sampling effect), and their absence can be just as ecologically significant as their presence. Spatial habitat borders can add heterogeneity to network structure, but their importance has rarely been studied: we explore how habitat generalization can be related to other resource dimensions. Many networks are hierarchically structured, with modules forming the basic building blocks, which can result in self-similarity. Scaling down from networks of species reveals another, finer-grained level of individual-based organization, the ecological consequences of which have yet to be fully explored. The few studies of individual-based ecological networks that are available suggest the potential for large intraspecific variance and, in the case of food webs, strong size-structuring. However, such data are still scarce and more studies are required to link individual-level and species-level networks. Invasions by alien species can be tracked by following the topological 'career' of the invader as it establishes itself within a network, with potentially important implications for conservation biology. Finally, by scaling up to a higher level of organization, it is possible to combine different network types (e.g. food webs and mutualistic networks) to form super networks, and this new approach has yet to be integrated into mainstream ecological research. We conclude by listing a set of research topics that we see as emerging candidates for ecological network studies in the near future. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Conserving such mobile species is challenging; the effectiveness of a conservation action taken at one site depends on the condition of other sites that may be geographically and politically distant (thousands of kilometers away or in another jurisdiction, for example). Recent work has shown that even simple and predictable linkages among sites caused by "to-and-fro" migration can make migratory species especially vulnerable to habitat loss, and substantially affect the results of conservation prioritizations. Species characterized by more erratic or nomadic movements are very difficult to protect through current conservation planning techniques, which typically view species distributions as static.

A method of assessing the biodiversity value of conserving a set of different sites is calculate their complementarity, richness and rarity, then combine them with the threats that these ares would face. To set which are the charachteristics that you will look for when you select certain sites you need to have a goal to base your decisions on.

We quantified the global protection of elevational gradients by analyzing the elevational distributions of 44,155 PAs in 1,010 mountain ranges using the highest resolution digital elevation models available. We show that, on average, mountain ranges in Africa and Asia have the lowest elevational protection, ranges in Europe and South America have intermediate elevational protection, and ranges in North America and Oceania have the highest elevational protection. We use the Convention on Biological Diversity's Aichi Target 11 to assess the proportion of elevational gradients meeting the 17{\%} suggested minimum target and examine how different protection categories contribute to elevational protection. When considering only strict PAs [International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) categories I–IV, n = 24,706], nearly 40{\%} of ranges do not contain any PAs, roughly half fail to meet the 17{\%} target at any elevation, and ∼75{\%} fail to meet the target throughout ≥50{\%} of the elevational gradient. Observed elevational protection is well below optimal, and frequently below a null model of elevational protection. Including less stringent PAs (IUCN categories V–VI and nondesignated PAs, n = 19,449) significantly enhances elevational protection for most continents, but several highly biodiverse ranges require new or expanded PAs to increase elevational protection. Ensuring conservation outcomes for PAs with lower IUCN designations as well as strategically placing PAs to better represent and connect elevational gradients will enhance ecological representation and facilitate species range shifts under climate change.},

abstract = {Current species extinction rates are at unprecedentedly high levels. While human activities can be the direct cause of some extinctions, it is becoming increasingly clear that species extinctions themselves can be the cause of further extinctions, since species affect each other through the network of ecological interactions among them. There is concern that the simplification of ecosystems, due to the loss of species and ecological interactions, increases their vulnerability to such secondary extinctions. It is predicted that more complex food webs will be less vulnerable to secondary extinctions due to greater trophic redundancy that can buffer against the effects of species loss. Here, we demonstrate in a field experiment with replicated plant-insect communities, that the probability of secondary extinctions is indeed smaller in food webs that include trophic redundancy. Harvesting one species of parasitoid wasp led to secondary extinctions of other, indirectly linked, species at the same trophic level. This effect was markedly stronger in simple communities than for the same species within a more complex food web. We show that this is due to functional redundancy in the more complex food webs and confirm this mechanism with a food web simulation model by highlighting the importance of the presence and strength of trophic links providing redundancy to those links that were lost. Our results demonstrate that biodiversity loss, leading to a reduction in redundant interactions, can increase the vulnerability of ecosystems to secondary extinctions, which, when they occur, can then lead to further simplification and run-away extinction cascades.},

abstract = {Two oft-cited drawbacks of kernel density estimators (KDEs) of home range are their sensitivity to the choice of smoothing parameter(s) and their need for independent data. Several simulation studies have been conducted to compare the performance of objective, data-based methods of choosing optimal smoothing parameters in the context of home range and utilization distribution (UD) estimation. Lost in this discussion of choice of smoothing parameters is the general role of smoothing in data analysis, namely, that smoothing serves to increase precision at the cost of increased bias. A primary goal of this paper is to illustrate this bias-variance trade-off by applying KDEs to sampled locations from simulated movement paths. These simulations will also be used to explore the role of autocorrelation in estimating UDs. Autocorrelation can be reduced (1) by increasing study duration (for a fixed sample size) or (2) by decreasing the sampling rate. While the first option will often be reasonable, for a fixed study duration higher sampling rates should always result in improved estimates of space use. Further, KDEs with typical data-based methods of choosing smoothing parameters should provide competitive estimates of space use for fixed study periods unless autocorrelation substantially alters the optimal level of smoothing.},

abstract = {Climate change, land-use change and introductions of non-native species are key determinants of biodiversity change worldwide. However, the extent to which anthropogenic drivers of environmental change interact to affect biological communities is largely unknown, especially over longer time periods. Here, we show that plant community composition in 996 Swedish landscapes has consistently shifted to reflect the warmer and wetter climate that the region has experienced during the second half of the 20th century. Using community climatic indices, which reflect the average climatic associations of the species within each landscape at each time period, we found that species compositions in 74{\%} of landscapes now have a higher representation of warm-associated species than they did previously, while 84{\%} of landscapes now host more species associated with higher levels of precipitation. In addition to a warmer and wetter climate, there have also been large shifts in land use across the region, while the fraction of non-native species has increased in the majority of landscapes. Climatic warming at the landscape level appeared to favour the colonization of warm-associated species, while also potentially driving losses in cool-associated species. However, the resulting increases in community thermal means were apparently buffered by landscape simplification (reduction in habitat heterogeneity within landscapes) in the form of increased forest cover. Increases in non-native species, which generally originate from warmer climates than Sweden, were a strong driver of community-level warming. In terms of precipitation, both landscape simplification and increases in non-natives appeared to favour species associated with drier climatic conditions, to some extent counteracting the climate-driven shift towards wetter communities. Anthropogenic drivers can act both synergistically and antagonistically to determine trajectories of change in biological communities over time. Therefore, it is important to consider multiple drivers of global change when trying to understand, manage and predict biodiversity in the future.},

abstract = {Species are the unit of analysis in many global change and conservation biology studies; however, species are not uniform entities but are composed of different, sometimes locally adapted, populations differing in plasticity. We examined how intraspecific variation in thermal niches and phenotypic plasticity will affect species distributions in a warming climate. We first developed a conceptual model linking plasticity and niche breadth, providing five alternative intraspecific scenarios that are consistent with existing literature. Secondly, we used ecological niche-modeling techniques to quantify the impact of each intraspecific scenario on the distribution of a virtual species across a geographically realistic setting. Finally, we performed an analogous modeling exercise using real data on the climatic niches of different tree provenances. We show that when population differentiation is accounted for and dispersal is restricted, forecasts of species range shifts under climate change are even more pessimistic than those using the conventional assumption of homogeneously high plasticity across a species' range. Suitable population-level data are not available for most species so identifying general patterns of population differentiation could fill this gap. However, the literature review revealed contrasting patterns among species, urging greater levels of integration among empirical, modeling and theoretical research on intraspecific phenotypic variation.},

@article{Nilsson2017,
abstract = {Introduction To grow and reproduce is fundamental for living organisms. In essence all organisms go through a life cycle with ontogenetically driven changes in their physiological rates and trophic interactions (Figure 9.1; Box 9.1). This ontogenetic development occurs even in unicellular organisms but is more striking in other groups. For example: dragonflies undergo metamorphoses that span several habitats, Atlantic marlin increase up to 500 times their length, and the cod-worm has different host requirements for each life-history stage. All of these ontogenetic changes correspond to large shifts in the ecological role of an individual. In spite of the drastic changes many individuals undergo over their life history, classical ecological theory typically assumes that all individuals within a population are identical. As a consequence, a large part of our ecological understanding relies on this assumption. This is surprising considering that ecological theory strongly links to evolution, which is critically dependent on variation among individuals. Acknowledging ecological variation of individuals within the species is relatively recent to food-web ecology. While individual variation can arise from genetic or stochastic processes, this chapter focuses on individual variation that relates to ontogenetic development. Biological interactions that are susceptible to ontogenetic variation include: resource use, vulnerability to predators and parasites, mutualistic interactions, cannibalism, and commensalism. Therefore the consideration of ontogeny has major implications for the way we consider food-web topology (Box 9.2). In a broader sense, the function of an organism, such as the nutrient fluxes it contributes to and the ecosystem services it takes part in, may also change over ontogeny. By ignoring the individual life history, ecologists focus on interactions between populations rather than between individuals, an abstraction that may be biologically inaccurate. In fact, differences between individuals within species can exceed, and have larger effects on food-web dynamics, than differences between individuals of different species. This suggests that the consideration of differences between life stages within populations is essential for our understanding of food-web structure and ecosystem functioning.},

abstract = {Distributions of Earth's species are changing at accelerating rates, increasingly driven by humanmediated climate change. Such changes are already altering the composition of ecological communities, but beyond conservation of natural systems, how and why does this matter? We review evidence that climate-driven species redistribution at regional to global scales affects ecosystem functioning, human well-being, and the dynamics of climate change itself. Production of natural resources required for food security, patterns of disease transmission, and processes of carbon sequestration are all altered by changes in species distribution. Consideration of these effects of biodiversity redistribution is critical yet lacking in most mitigation and adaptation strategies, including the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals.},
annote = {Climate change will continue to increase the average temperature of our planet for at least the next 100 years, even if we stopped today with releasing greenhouse gasses. Another problem with effects that we can't control is the extinction debt. [It is possible that we have already triggered populations to enter the extinction vortex. Some species might have been put into this extinction debt because we have destroyed some patches that were useful for their metapopulations (that might be applied also to metacommunities). We could save them by recreating those patches.] 
  
One of the challenges that faces us – and that is not enough addressed – is the redistribution of biodiversity. This will have many effects on the health and type of ecosystems in the world. And considering that societies rely on ecosystems for their services (direct, indirect, aesthetic, recreational, psychological {\&} spiritual) we would be in big troubles if we don't address them properly before it's too late. Many systems have sudden changes when they reach a tipping point: after nothing has happened for a long time, the loss of species or other negative effects reaches the point where the ecosystem collapse in a small period of time. So, even if we don't see the effects on the ecosystem right now it doesn't mean that nothing is happening. It also means that if we wait to see something happening it might be too late in some cases. 
  
Biodiversity redistribution will have many effects on ecosystems. Certain species will adapt to changes in the climate and will keep staying in the historical areas. [GE1] Other species will be able to shift their ranges to cooler areas (toward the poles, uphill or in deeper water). The species that won't be able to adapt or move fast enough will get extinct. The focus of this paper is on the redistribution of biodiversity, which means the movement of the species that won't be able to adapt locally but that will be able to shift their ranges. [This will be the case for species that can migrate really fast. But a lot of species can't. For example: millipedes, spiders, worms, trees that have seeds that can't move much] These moving species will cause novel communities to arise, old communities will be affected by the loss of keystone species and the species moving into new communities will have effects similar to the ones of invasive species [Not all of them, but just the ones that will be able to become dominant, that's the meaning of invasive species]. This reorganisation of communities might have great effects on ecosystem functioning. This is because they might lose functional biodiversity that is essential for ecosystem functioning. 
  
Biodiversity redistribution will trigger climate change feedbacks. At the moment, we are quite confident about which feedbacks will be triggered at the poles, but we don't which ones will be triggered at the tropics. The main feedback mechanisms (positive or negative) that will be triggered by the redistribution of biodiversity are: 
-       Decrease in albedo. Caused by: 
o   Ice melting, where liquid water has lower albedo than ice. 
o   Colonisation of mountaintops, where plants have lower albedo than bare rocks. 
o   Shift of tundra into taiga, which has lower albedo. 
-       Release of greenhouse gasses. Caused by: 
o   Melting of permafrost, which releases methane. However, it is possible that bushes that colonise permafrost area will cool down the soil and will reduce the melting of permafrost. 
o   Burning of forests, which release carbon dioxide. Forests will be more and more susceptible to fire because of disease killing trees (dead trees are drier and spread fire better than alive trees) and warmer temperatures and drought making them drier (or killing them). 
-       Changes in carbon storage. Caused by: 
o   Suppression of phytoplankton bloom. This will decrease the amount of carbon that sinks to the bottom of the ocean through the biological pump. The proliferation of phytoplankton is going to stop because the warm water on the top prevents the cold-water reach of nutrients to rise to the top. 
o   Changes in the composition of phytoplankton. For example, if the amount of Coccolithophores increase, this will increase the counter pump, releasing carbon from the ocean into the atmosphere. [However, that the more the ocean becomes acid the more difficult it will be for organisms to produce hard shells made out of calcium carbonate] 
-       Changes in the production of DMS. Caused by: 
o   Changes in the phytoplankton. It's not sure tough how phytoplankton is related to DMS and if it has a positive or a negative effect on global warming.  
-       Loss of the connection between land and marine systems. Caused by: 
o   Different things. For example, dust coming from the desert and entering inside the ocean causes phytoplankton blooms because it's reaches in iron. 
  
Biodiversity redistribution will have many and scaring effects on human societies. The main effects are going to be: 
{\textperiodcentered}      Loss of species that were used directly as a resource. For example, trees that were profitable for the timber industry or fish profitable for fisheries. 
{\textperiodcentered}      Loss of species important for tourism. For example, species that were used for fishing tourism or ecotourism. I add I think that this is such a small part of tourism and global economy that can be almost overseen. 
{\textperiodcentered}      Decrease in crop yields. This is due to the new diseases, pests and I add to the modification of the whole ecosystem. 
{\textperiodcentered}      Decrease in human health. This is due to new diseases being carried by animals to temperate zones and I add also to pathogens finding new vectors. 70{\%} of the emerging diseases in the past decades have been found to be animal-borne. 
{\textperiodcentered}      Disruption of economies. The redistribution of biodiversity will disrupt economies by producing winners and losers. If a country wins or loses will depend by the magnitude of the disruption and by the response to it. 
{\textperiodcentered}      Arise of conflicts between different stakeholders. E.g. fisheries from different countries or between conservation and ski areas in the Italian Alps. 
  
Considering the way we manage biodiversity at the moment and the projections of its distribution in the future it's clear that we need to change the way we manage biodiversity. 
A proper biodiversity management needs the understanding of the biological mechanisms by which species shift their range, monitor and assess populations and have an effective communication with the public and the policy makers. Furthermore, governments need to manage biodiversity by: 
{\textperiodcentered}      Managing species at different jurisdictions and communicating between the managers of species of the old range and of the new range 
{\textperiodcentered}      Allowing species to move to new areas and recognizing that species that were historically found in a certain area might not be there anymore in the future 
{\textperiodcentered}      Being flexible about the denomination of certain areas. It might be possible that what was previously an area used for construction will need to be used for conservation in the near future. 
  
We can't reach many of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) set for 2050 if we don't address the effects of biodiversity redistribution. These have been set by the United Nations (UN) for a better future for the humanity. However, it should take into consideration also biodiversity redistribution not only if we want to improve human conditions but also if we don't want to make them worse. The goals that could not be met if we don't address this issue are: 
{\textperiodcentered}      Zero Hunger. Biodiversity redistribution is likely to decrease crop yield (through changes in the distribution of pests, diseases and pollinators) and change the range of fish. 
{\textperiodcentered}      Human wellbeing {\&} good health. This couldn't be met because of biodiversity redistribution might affect: 
o   The amount of food we can produce (see above). 
o   The spread of diseases. Especially animal-borne diseases. 
o   The presence of species that are important for certain cultures. 
o   The distribution of wild species that support certain cultures. 
{\textperiodcentered}      Climate action, life below water and life on land.},

The parameters considered include periodical changes in soil nutrient status, agronomic efficiency,of nitrogen (AEN), grain yield and return on investment (ROI). The treatments were arranged in split-plot design fitted into a randomized complete block design, with varieties as the main plots and varying fertilizer management treatments using organic (Pureganic and Vermicompost) and inorganic fertilizers as the subplots. NSIC Rc9 variety performed better in terms of growth and grain yield than Inipot-Ibon, a traditional variety; it had higher harvest index, number of spikelets, filled grains and AEN. Generally, inorganic fertilizers improved the grain and straw yields as well as the AEN of NSIC Rc9 compared with Inipot-ibon. Applying organic fertilizer did not increase the grain yield of both NSIC Rc9 and Inipot-ibon in two consecutive croppings. No significant effect of varieties or fertilizer management was observed on the soil organic matter (SOM), total available nitrogen, available phosphorus and exchangeable potassium but the values tended to decline every season after cropping of upland rice. In general, the ROI obtained from upland rice production was either break-even or had negative returns, making upland rice production less profitable.},

abstract = {Humans have drastically changed much of the world's acoustic background with anthropogenic sounds that are markedly different in pitch and amplitude than sounds in most natural habitats [1-4]. This novel acoustic background may be detrimental for many species, particularly birds [1]. We evaluated conservation concerns that noise limits bird distributions and reduces nesting success via a natural experiment to isolate the effects of noise from confounding stimuli and to control for the effect of noise on observer detection biases [5]. We show that noise alone reduces nesting species richness and leads to different avian communities. Contrary to expectations, noise indirectly facilitates reproductive success of individuals nesting in noisy areas as a result of the disruption of predator-prey interactions. The higher reproductive success for birds within noisy habitats may be a previously unrecognized factor contributing to the success of urban-adapted species and the loss of birds less tolerant of noise. Additionally, our findings suggest that noise can have cascading consequences for communities through altered species interactions. Given that noise pollution is becoming ubiquitous throughout much of the world, knowledge of species-specific responses to noise and the cumulative effects of these novel acoustics may be crucial to understanding and managing human-altered landscapes. {\textcopyright}2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A current principle of ecological stoichiometry states that the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio (N:P) of primary producers should closely match that from environmental nutrient supplies. This hypothesis was tested using data from ponds in Michigan, USA, a freshwater mesocosm experiment, a synthesis of studies from diverse systems (cultures, lakes, streams, and marine and terrestrial environments), and simple dynamic models of producer growth and nutrient content. Unlike prior laboratory studies, the N:P stoichiometry of phytoplankton in Michigan ponds clustered around and below the Redfield ratio (7.2:1 by mass), despite wide variation in N:P supply ratios (2:1-63:1 by mass) and the presence of grazers. In a mesocosm experiment, the N:P stoichiometry of phytoplankton cells again deviated from a nearly 1:1 relationship with N:P supply. Phytoplankton seston exhibited lower N:P content than expected at high N:P supply ratios, and often higher N:P content than anticipated at low N:P supply ratios, regardless of herbivore presence. Similar deviations consistently occur in the N:P stoichiometry of algae and plants in the other diverse systems. The models predicted that both high loss rates (sinking, grazing) and physiological limits to nutrient storage capacity could attenuate producer stoichiometry. In the future, research should evaluate how limits to elemental plasticity of producers can influence the role of stoichiometry in structuring communities and ecosystem processes. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.},

These upslope shifts are predicted to lead to mountaintop extinctions of species that live only near mountain summits, but empirical examples of populations that have disappeared are sparse. We show that recent warming constitutes an “escalator to extinction” for birds on a remote Peruvian mountain—high-elevation species have declined in both range size and abundance, and several previously common mountaintop residents have disappeared from the local community. Our findings support projections that warming will likely drive widespread extirpations and extinctions of high-elevation taxa in the tropical Andes. Such climate change-driven mountaintop extirpations may be more likely in the tropics, where temperature seems to exert a stronger control on species' range limits than in the temperate zone. In contrast, we show that lowland bird species at our study site are expanding in range size as they shift their upper limits upslope and may thus benefit from climate change.},
annote = {Species are expected to move upslope until they reach the mountaintop and get extinct. That's what the authors call the escalator to extinction. To understand it better we need more evidences so that we can act through policies by protecting all different mountain elevation and creating corridors to allow species to move upslope. The problem, however, would be that species would still face extinction once also the top is too warm. A possibility would be using assisted colonization if the species can't reach an area with higher elevation by itself. 
  
Global warming will cause also an increased fitness in the lowland species which would benefit from having warmer climates upslope but maintaining their original range. 
  
Species that are the most influenced by temperature changes seem to be the ones living in the tropics and ectothermic animals more than endothermic animals. 
  
Models predicting the range shift in species upslope have been more useful for predicting what happens in the tropics than in the temperate zones. This shows us that temperature (or variables that are strongly correlated with it) are more important to predict the distribution of species in the tropics than in the temperate zones. This might be explained by the fact that species in the tropics are adapted to deal with small ranges of temperatures, but species living in temperate zones are more flexible. Socola et al. (2017) found that species in the tropics seem to have more changes in their phenological cycles than in their range distribution. Another explanation can be that they have problems at migrating toward the poles. This is because the gradient of temperature in the tropics is way lighter than in temperate zones. 
  
Ectothermic animals depend by temperature in a strong way. This is why they might be affected strongly by temperature changes. If certain species are highly dependent by the presence of ectothermic species than they will shift their range as well (even if their distribution is not directly controlled by temperatures).},

abstract = {A change in a climate variable may alter a species' abundance not only through a direct effect on that species' vital rates, but also through 'indirect' effects mediated by species interactions. While recent work has highlighted cases in which indirect effects overwhelm the direct effects of climate, we lack robust generalizations to predict the strength of indirect effects. For communities dominated by non-trophic interactions, we propose that the potential for indirect effects of climate change declines with the strength of stabilizing niche differences. We tested this hypothesis by analysing an empirically parameterized four species population model. We quantified negative frequency dependence in population growth rates as a measure of stabilizing niche differences and projected the sensitivity of each species to direct and indirect effects of climate perturbations. Consistent with our hypothesis, species' sensitivities to indirect effects decreased rapidly with increasing stabilization by niche differences. Synthesis. Information about niche differences can identify species sensitive to indirect effects of climate change and determine when multispecies forecasting approaches are necessary. However, practical application of this generalization will require methods to predict niche differences from easily collected data. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {The relationship between structure and stability in ecological networks and the effect of spatial dynamics on natural communities have both been major foci of ecological research for decades. Network research has traditionally focused on a single interaction type at a time (e.g. food webs, mutualistic networks). Networks comprising different types of interactions have recently started to be empirically characterized. Patterns observed in these networks and their implications for stability demand for further theoretical investigations. Here, we employed a spatially explicit model to disentangle the effects of mutualism/antagonism ratios in food web dynamics and stability. We found that increasing levels of plant-animal mutualistic interactions generally resulted in more stable communities. More importantly, increasing the proportion of mutualistic vs. antagonistic interactions at the base of the food web affects different aspects of ecological stability in different directions, although never negatively. Stability is either not influenced by increasing mutualism—for the cases of population stability and species' spatial distributions—or is positively influenced by it—for spatial aggregation of species. Additionally, we observe that the relative increase of mutualistic relationships decreases the strength of biotic interactions in general within the ecological network. Our work highlights the importance of considering several dimensions of stability simultaneously to understand the dynamics of communities comprising multiple interaction types.},

We used simulations to demonstrate the inconsistency of kernel estimators at determining the home-range size of random distributions. Furthermore, we used the positions of ten adult male Lampropeltis triangulum radio-tracked over two full active seasons (2003 and 2004) to demonstrate that the size of the home range increases significantly with an increase in the smoothing factor. The degree of increase, however, was not consistent between individuals. In addition, using least-squares cross-validation to select the smoothing factor produced a wide range of values for different individuals. Because of these inconsistencies, we suggest using the minimum convex polygon (MCP) method to calculate home-range size in studies of herpetofauna.

abstract = {Species interactions are a key component of ecosystems but we generally have an incomplete picture of who-eats-who in a given community. Different techniques have been devised to predict species interactions using theoretical models or abundances. Here, we explore the K nearest neighbour approach, with a special emphasis on recommendation, along with a supervised machine learning technique. Recommenders are algorithms developed for companies like Netflix to predict whether a customer will like a product given the preferences of similar customers. These machine learning techniques are well-suited to study binary ecological interactions since they focus on positive-only data. By removing a prey from a predator, we find that recommenders can guess the missing prey around 50{\%} of the times on the first try, with up to 881 possibilities. Traits do not improve significantly the results for the K nearest neighbour, although a simple test with a supervised learning approach (random forests) show we can predict interactions with high accuracy using only three traits per species. This result shows that binary interactions can be predicted without regard to the ecological community given only three variables: body mass and two variables for the species' phylogeny. These techniques are complementary, as recommenders can predict interactions in the absence of traits, using only information about other species' interactions, while supervised learning algorithms such as random forests base their predictions on traits only but do not exploit other species' interactions. Further work should focus on developing custom similarity measures specialized for ecology to improve the KNN algorithms and using richer data to capture indirect relationships between species.},

Since there are several notoriously difficult methodological problems with food webs, only a comparative perspective can help. We study a standard database for trophic flow networks and analyse the correlation between structure and dynamics in strictly hierarchical food webs (directed acyclic graphs, DAGs). To characterize the structural information about trophic nodes in food webs (their positional importance), we use 8 topological indices that had been developed for quantifying DAGs (3 indices related to status, s, and 5 indices related to the keystone index, K). For dynamics, we use the KS (keystoneness) index that quantifies the importance of trophic nodes in the food web, considering also carbon flows and biomass. We statistically compare the structural and dynamical importance of each network node and find that the K indices are much better predictors of KS than the s indices. Based on these results, we suggest that functional studies have to consider both bottom-up and top-down effects as well as indirect effects that are dampening with distance. We suggest that this kind of study can be helpful to better understand the relevance and applicability of network analysis, an otherwise popular research methodology with continuously increasing predictive power.},

abstract = {1. Although the home range is a fundamental ecological concept, there is considerable debate over how it is best measured. There is a substantial literature concerning the precision and accuracy of all commonly used home range estimation methods; however, there has been considerably less work concerning how estimates vary with sampling regime, and how this affects statistical inferences. 2. We propose a new procedure, based on a variance components analysis using generalized mixed effects models to examine how estimates vary with sampling regime. 3. To demonstrate the method we analyse data from one study of 32 individually marked roe deer and another study of 21 individually marked kestrels. We subsampled these data to simulate increasingly less intense sampling regimes, and compared the performance of two kernel density estimation (KDE) methods, of the minimum convex polygon (MCP) and of the bivariate ellipse methods. 4. Variation between individuals and study areas contributed most to the total variance in home range size. Contrary to recent concerns over reliability, both KDE methods were remarkably efficient, robust and unbiased: 10 fixes per month, if collected over a standardized number of days, were sufficient for accurate estimates of home range size. However, the commonly used 95{\%} isopleth should be avoided; we recommend using isopleths between 90 and 50{\%}. 5. Using the same number of fixes does not guarantee unbiased home range estimates: statistical inferences differ with the number of days sampled, even if using KDE methods. 6. The MCP method was highly inefficient and results were subject to considerable and unpredictable biases. The bivariate ellipse was not the most reliable method at low sample sizes. 7. We conclude that effort should be directed at marking more individuals monitored over long periods at the expense of the sampling rate per individual. Statistical results are reliable only if the whole sampling regime is standardized. We derive practical guidelines for field studies and data analysis.},

Phytoplankton had lower net productivity and higher respiration and zooplankton had, in general, higher respiration under the Future than that under the Present condition when organisms were exposed to UVR. The mid-term impacts of the Future condition were neither significant on zooplankton abundances, nor in phytoplankton abundances, biomass, and cell size. Nevertheless, the zooplankton–phytoplankton interaction strength was greater under the Future condition. Zooplankton exerted a strong top-down pressure, regardless of the experimental scenarios, grazing preferentially on small phytoplankton cells, thus decreasing their abundances and biomass. Overall, there were significant short-term impact of our Future global change scenario; however, its effects on mid-term time scales were not significant, and indeed, the zooplankton top-down pressure was the main driver that shaped the phytoplankton community.},

The first index, taxonomic diversity (A), can be thought of as the average taxono{\~{}}nic 'distance' between any two organisms, chosen at random from the sample: this distance can be visualized simply as the length of the path connecting these two organisms, traced through (say) a Linnean or phylogenetic classification of the full set of species involved. The second index, taxonomic distinctness (A*), is the average path length between any two randomly chosen individuals, conditional on them being from different species. This is equivalent to dividing taxono{\~{}}nic diversity, A, by the value it would take were there to be no taxononlic hierarchy (all species belonging to the same genus). A* can therefore be seen as a measure of pure taxono{\~{}}nic relatedness, whereas A mixes taxonomic relatedness with the evenness properties of the abundance distribution. 2. This paper explores the statistical sampling properties of A and A:! Taxonomic diversity is seen to be a natural extension of a form of Simpson's index, incorporating taxono{\~{}}nic (or phylogenetic) information. Importantly for practical comparisons, both A and A* are shown not to be dependent, on average, on the degree of sampling effort involved in the data collection; this is in sharp contrast with those diversity measures that are strongly influenced by the number of observed species. 3. The special case where the data consist only of presence/absence information is dealt with in detail: A and A'konverge to the same statistic (Ai), which is now defined as the average taxonomic path length between ally two ra{\~{}}ldomly chosen species. Its lack of dependence, in mean value, on sampling effort implies that A+ can be compared across studies with differing and uncontrolled degrees of sampling effort (subject to assumptions concerning comparable taxonoinic accuracy). This may be of particular significance for historic (diffusely collected) species lists from different localities or regions, which at first sight may seem unamenable to valid diversity comparison of any sort. 4. Furthermore, a randomization test is possible, to detect a difference in the taxonomic distinctness, for any observed set of species, from the 'expected' A+ value derived from a master species list for the relevant group of organisms. The exact rando{\~{}}nization procedure requires heavy computation, and an approximation is developed, by deriving an appropriate variance formula. This leads to a 'confidence funnel' against which distinctness values for any specific area, pollution condition, habitat type, etc., can be checked, and forlnally addresses the question of whether a putatively impacted locality has a 'lower than expected' taxonomic spread. The procedure is illustrated for the UK species list of free-living marine nematodes and sets of samples from intertidal sites in two localities, the Exe estuary and the Firth of Clyde.

However, global studies on climate change impacts on ocean biodiversity have not been performed so far. Our paper aims to investigate the global patterns of such impacts by projecting the distributional ranges of a sample of 1066 exploited marine fish and invertebrates for 2050 using a newly developed dynamic bioclimate envelope model. Our projections show that climate change may lead to numerous local extinction in the sub-polar regions, the tropics and semi-enclosed seas. Simultaneously, species invasion is projected to be most intense in the Arctic and the Southern Ocean. Together, they result in dramatic species turnovers of over 60{\%} of the present biodiversity, implying ecological disturbances that potentially disrupt ecosystem services. Our projections can be viewed as a set of hypothesis for future analytical and empirical studies. Keywords},

abstract = {Current predictions on species responses to climate change strongly rely on projecting altered environmental conditions on species distributions. However, it is increasingly acknowledged that climate change also influences species interactions. We review and synthesize literature information on biotic interactions and use it to argue that the abundance of species and the direction of selection during climate change vary depending on how their trophic interactions become disrupted. Plant abundance can be controlled by aboveground and belowground multitrophic level interactions with herbivores, pathogens, symbionts and their enemies. We discuss how these interactions may alter during climate change and the resulting species range shifts. We suggest conceptual analogies between species responses to climate warming and exotic species introduced in new ranges. There are also important differences: the herbivores, pathogens and mutualistic symbionts of rangeexpanding species and their enemies may co-migrate, and the continuous gene flow under climate warming can make adaptation in the expansion zone of range expanders different from that of cross-continental exotic species. We conclude that under climate change, results of altered species interactions may vary, ranging from species becoming rare to disproportionately abundant. Taking these possibilities into account will provide a new perspective on predicting species distribution under climate change. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {1. We examined the species richness of theoretical communities in relation to interaction strength between species. 2. To do so, we used randomly constructed interaction matrices for competitive systems. To determine co-existence, we tested for local stability and equilibrium feasibility of these theoretical assemblages. 3. As expected, we found that a low mean species interaction strength could allow for many species to co-exist. However, variance in the interaction strengths may alter previous results; two systems with the same mean interaction strength show markedly different diversity depending critically on the magnitude of the variance. If species are similar enough then many can co-exist, even if they compete strongly. 4. In addition we found that the species richness of a competitive community can greatly depend on the correlation between interaction strengths, an issue that so far has gone unreported. This correlation, a result of trade-offs between species' characteristics, may profoundly increase the potential for stable co-existence of a highly species-rich community. 5. Competition may not be an anathema to diversity. Statistical properties of species' interactions may be critical factors that contribute to the explanation of species diversity in natural communities.},

abstract = {Fish fauna were collected in two different subtidal shallow sites, seagrass and sand, using a small beam trawl in the Ria Formosa lagoon (South Portugal). Samples were taken at low and high tides, during day and night, and in each season. Fish assemblages associated with each site were significantly different, with seagrass site supporting greater fish abundance and higher number of species than sand. These site-related differences in fish assemblages were stronger than any other factor studied. Both sites showed seasonal variations in their fish assemblages, mainly because of recruitment of marine juvenile migrants during spring and summer. No significant tidal or diel changes were observed in the fish assemblages of either site, but there was a significant site-tide interaction, with higher fish abundance in seagrass at low tide. In sand, tide effect was evident only for certain species, with resident species more abundant at high tide and marine species more abundant at low tide. Within the Ria Formosa coastal lagoon, ichthyofaunal composition and structure is mainly influenced by site followed by season. {\textcopyright}2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {From butterflies to elephants, the rapidly developing science of movement ecology is providing increasingly detailed spatio-temporal data on a wide array of mobile animals. Thus, this discipline also holds great promise for improving the conservation of wildlife. To measure progress toward this promise, we investigated the degree to which movement ecology research is connected to conservation goals as well as the proportion of studies that were incorporated into federal and international status assessments for mobile species at risk. We examined 13,349 "movement ecology" papers published between 1990 and 2014 and found that explicit connections to conservation and management were made in 35{\%} (n = 4, 672) of these papers, with the number of connections increasing over time. We then measured the uptake of movement ecology research into species status assessment and recovery plans (n = 72 documents) produced by three different governance agencies for 12 endangered mobile species. We found that on average 60{\%} of available movement ecology research was used in the status assessment process, demonstrating that when movement ecology research is available, it is generally being utilized in conservation planning. However, for 25{\%} of these species, there was little movement research available to be used, highlighting that knowledge gaps remain for some at-risk species despite the general growth of movement ecology research. We outline opportunities for movement ecology to promote more effective conservation of taxa that move.},

abstract = {Abstract Field studies of endocrine function in a range of social mammals suggest that high dominance rank is commonly associated with elevated glucocorticoid production. This is puzzling, because in stable dominance hierarchies, high status is normally associated with social control and predictability, key predictors of low psychological stress. One solution to this problem may be that high rank is commonly associated with elevated energetic expenditure, leading to increased metabolic stress and glucocorticoid secretion. We conducted behavioural observations and non-invasive hormone sampling of male chimpanzees in Kibale National Park, Uganda, to examine the relationship between cortisol, dominance and stress in wild chimpanzees. Results indicate that male dominance rank positively correlated with urinary cortisol excretion in a stable dominance hierarchy. Cortisol excretion also correlated positively with rates of male aggression. We suggest that the relationship between cortisol and rank in chimpanzees may be driven by energetic factors rather than psychosocial ones. This interpretation is supported by the observation that urinary cortisol levels correlated negatively with food availability. These findings suggest that dominant chimpanzees experience significant metabolic costs that must be set against the presumed reproductive benefits of high rank. Metabolic stress may mediate the relationship between rank and cortisol in other social mammals.},

We analyzed how the scaling of biomass densities with population-averaged body masses systematically interacts with stoichiometric variables. Simplified analyses employing either only body masses or only resource stoichiometry are highly context sensitive and yield variable and often misleading results. Our findings provide strong evidence that analyses of ecological state variables should integrate allometric and stoichiometric variables to explain deviations from predicted allometric scaling and avoid erroneous conclusions.

abstract = {Complementary resource use and redundancy of species that fulfill the same ecological role are two mechanisms that can respectively increase and stabilize process rates in ecosystems. For example, predator complementarity and redundancy can determine prey consumption rates and their stability, yet few studies take into account the multiple predator species attacking multiple prey at different rates in natural communities. Thus, it remains unclear whether these biodiversity mechanisms are important determinants of consumption in entire predator-prey assemblages, such that food-web interaction structure determines community-wide consumption and stability. Here, we use empirical quantitative food webs to study the community-wide effects of functional complementarity and redundancy of consumers (parasitoids) on herbivore control in temperate forests. We find that complementarity in host resource use by parasitoids was a strong predictor of absolute parasitism rates at the community level and that redundancy in host-use patterns stabilized community-wide parasitism rates in space, but not through time. These effects can potentially explain previous contradictory results from predator diversity research. Phylogenetic diversity (measured using taxonomic distance) did not explain functional complementarity or parasitism rates, so could not serve as a surrogate measure for functional complementarity. Our study shows that known mechanisms underpinning predator diversity effects on both functioning and stability can easily be extended to link food webs to ecosystem functioning. {\textcopyright} 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Aquaculture has been proposed as one solution to address unsustainable trade for traditional medicine, aquarium fishes and curios. Here we review historical and current information on global seahorse aquaculture including characteristics of aquaculture operations, species in culture, contribution to international trade and technical issues associated with raising seahorses in captivity. We found that prior to the 1990s, seahorse aquaculture was plagued by problems with disease and feeding. In the late 1990s and early 2000s there was considerable expansion in the number and size of aquaculture operations and the number of species in culture. This was reflected in an increasing contribution of captive-bred seahorses to the aquarium trade but not in the larger traditional medicine market. Currently, the majority of seahorse aquaculture involves small-scale operations in developed countries, employing relatively few personnel and selling live animals for the home aquarium market. Although, there are still considerable technical problems with diseases and with breeding and raising some species, others are performing successfully in aquaculture. There are currently at least 13 species in commercial culture or under research for their culture potential. However, economic viability remains a concern to many current aquaculture operations including price competition with wild-caught animals. Large-scale aquaculture to supply the traditional medicine market or as a livelihood venture has not yet been demonstrated to be commercially viable, although it is being actively researched. {\textcopyright}2009 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Understanding what structures ecological communities is vital to answering questions about extinctions, environmental change, trophic cascades, and ecosystem functioning. Optimal foraging theory was conceived to increase such understanding by providing a framework with which to predict species interactions and resulting community structure. Here, we use an optimal foraging model and allometries of foraging variables to predict the structure of real food webs. The qualitative structure of the resulting model provides a more mechanistic basis for the phenomenological rules of previous models. Quantitative analyses show that the model predicts up to 65{\%} of the links in real food webs. The deterministic nature of the model allows analysis of the model's successes and failures in predicting particular interactions. Predacious and herbivorous feeding interactions are better predicted than pathogenic, parasitoid, and parasitic interactions. Results also indicate that accurate prediction and modeling of some food webs will require incorporating traits other than body size and diet choice models specific to different types of feeding interaction. The model results support the hypothesis that individual behavior, subject to natural selection, determines individual diets and that food web structure is the sum of these individual decisions. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Networks (or graphs) appear as dominant structures in diverse domains, including sociology, biology, neuroscience and computer science. In most of the aforementioned cases graphs are directed - in the sense that there is directionality on the edges, making the semantics of the edges nonsymmetric as the source node transmits some property to the target one but not vice versa. An interesting feature that real networks present is the clustering or community structure property, under which the graph topology is organized into modules commonly called communities or clusters. The essence here is that nodes of the same community are highly similar while on the contrary, nodes across communities present low similarity. Revealing the underlying community structure of directed complex networks has become a crucial and interdisciplinary topic with a plethora of relevant application domains. Therefore, naturally there is a recent wealth of research production in the area of mining directed graphs - with clustering being the primary method sought and the primary tool for community detection and evaluation. The goal of this paper is to offer an in-depth comparative review of the methods presented so far for clustering directed networks along with the relevant necessary methodological background and also related applications. The survey commences by offering a concise review of the fundamental concepts and methodological base on which graph clustering algorithms capitalize on. Then we present the relevant work along two orthogonal classifications. The first one is mostly concerned with the methodological principles of the clustering algorithms, while the second one approaches the methods from the viewpoint regarding the properties of a good cluster in a directed network. Further, we present methods and metrics for evaluating graph clustering results, demonstrate interesting application domains and provide promising future research directions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Predation-pressure is regarded as being the most important factor “shaping” the assemblages. The shaping involves the choice of inaccessible or otherwise safe sites, optimum dispersal, mutual awareness of attack and joint defensive tactics, and serves to minimise the vulnerability to predation which would otherwise result when birds mass together in conspicuous, and often predictable centres.},

abstract = {We experimentally warmed a series of shallow enclosures by 4.5°C and measured responses of the epilithon (biofilm on rocky surfaces) and invertebrates. Maximum rates of net photosynthesis increased by 28-115{\%} and rates of dark respiration increased by 29-103{\%} as a result of warming. Long-term analyses using data from unmanipulated Lake 239 corroborated these findings, showing that rates of light-saturated photosynthesis and dark respiration were positively correlated with water temperature. Warming effects differed between communities (on natural and tile substrates, as well as well-developed and early successional communities). Warming consistently led to increased bacterial cell densities, but increases in total algal biovolume and diatom biovolume were seen only in an early successional tile community. Effects on the composition of the invertebrate community (studied only on well-developed tile biofilms) were small. We observed warming-related increases in carbon accrual within one community, and late in the experiment observed a change in carbon : phosphorus ratios of another community, possibly indicative of a degradation of food quality. Our study suggests that climate warming effects on epilithic community composition are likely to be heterogeneous and difficult to predict; however, the agreement between long-term and experimental results suggests that increased temperatures will increase metabolic rates of the epilithon. {\textcopyright} 2005, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.},

abstract = {The stability of ecological communities largely depends on the strength of interactions between predators and their prey. Here we show that these interaction strengths are structured nonrandomly in a large Caribbean marine food web. Specifically, the cooccurrence of strong interactions on two consecutive levels of food chains occurs less frequently than expected by chance. Even when they occur, these strongly interacting chains are accompanied by strong omnivory more often than expected by chance. By using a food web model, we show that these interaction strength combinations reduce the likelihood of trophic cascades after the overfishing of top predators. However, fishing selectively removes predators that are overrepresented in strongly interacting chains. Hence, the potential for strong community-wide effects remains a threat. {\textcopyright} 2005 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {The effects of the insecticide Dursban{\textregistered} 4E (active ingredient chlorpyrifos) on aspects of water chemistry, community metabolism, and decomposition of particulate organic matter were studied in indoor freshwater microcosms intended to mimic drainage ditches. To several of these systems, a single dose (simulating aerial drift) was applied to achieve nominal chlorpyrifos concentrations of 5 or 35 $\mu$g/L. Two experiments were performed; one, in which all model ecosystems were dominated by the macrophyte Elodea nuttallii, and one, using systems devoid of macrophytes. The response of ecosystem functioning is discussed in relation to the shifts in community structure observed. Treatment effects on community metabolism, as signaled by a decrease in dissolved oxygen and pH and an increase in alkalinity and conductivity, could be observed in the high-dose Elodea-dominated microcosms only. In addition, Dursban 4E application in these systems resulted in a more persistent decrease in the decay rate of macrophyte material present in litter bags than in open water microcosms. Concentrations of inorganic nitrogen and orthophosphate in the water column of both types of model ecosystem were hardly affected by insecticide application. It is concluded that the impact of Dursban 4E on ecosystem functioning differed considerably between the two types of model ecosystems, and that functional endpoints were more robust than structural properties. {\textcopyright} 1993 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.},

abstract = {Macroecological models for predicting species distributions usually only include abiotic environmental conditions as explanatory variables, despite knowledge from community ecology that all species are linked to other species through biotic interactions. This disconnect is largely due to the different spatial scales considered by the two sub-disciplines: macroecologists study patterns at large extents and coarse resolutions, while community ecologists focus on small extents and fine resolutions. A general framework for including biotic interactions in macroecological models would help bridge this divide, as it would allow for rigorous testing of the role that biotic interactions play in determining species ranges. Here, we present an approach that combines species distribution models with Bayesian networks, which enables the direct and indirect effects of biotic interactions to be modelled as propagating conditional dependencies among species' presences. We show that including biotic interactions in distribution models for species from a California grassland community results in better range predictions across the western USA. This new approach will be important for improving estimates of species distributions and their dynamics under environmental change.},

Aims: To describe diet and growth of Little Tern chicks, to examine the influence of tide and wind speed on food delivered to chicks in southern Portugal, and to determine whether diet and early chick growth parameters differed between birds breeding in natural (sandy beaches) and man-made alternative (salinas) habitats. Methods: Nests were marked and visited regularly. Chicks were ringed and weighed at hatching. Between 12 and 14 nests were enclosed by a fence in order to measure and weigh chicks every day. Prey items delivered to fenced chicks were observed daily from hides, in different tidal periods and wind speed conditions. Prey items dropped in the colonies were collected. Foraging efficiency of adults was evaluated in relation to tide and wind speed. Fresh prey items were collected to determine their energetic content using a calorimeter. Results: chicks grew faster than length at 19 days old; spp., in early growth parameters. items were chicks, but both attained the same weight, tarsus-length and wing- chicks attained the same values at day 21 There were significant differences and spp. and chicks grew faster on sandy beaches than on salinas.

There was no correlation between ingestion rate and chick age, but mean length of prey ingested by chicks increased significantly with age. Conclusion: Tide and wind speed influenced both size and type of prey delivered to chicks. Parents met the increasing energy demands of the growing chicks by adjusting prey size rather than prey delivery frequency. Differences in chick growth between salinas and sandy beaches could be related to both parental quality and diet. The presence of a high energy-content euryhaline fish species in the salinas, together with more sheltered conditions and no tidal influences, may be important in explaining the use of salinas by Little Terns.

Arguments are passionate on both sides and debate has remained subjective and unresolved because experimental evidence of the ecological impacts of dog walking has been lacking. Here we show that dog walking in woodland leads to a 35{\%} reduction in bird diversity and 41{\%} reduction in abundance, both in areas where dog walking is common and where dogs are prohibited.

abstract = {1. A fundamental goal of ecological network research is to understand how the complexity observed in nature can persist and how this affects ecosystem functioning. This is essential for us to be able to predict, and eventually mitigate, the consequences of increasing environmental perturbations such as habitat loss, climate change, and invasions of exotic species. 2. Ecological networks can be subdivided into three broad types: 'traditional' food webs, mutualistic networks and host-parasitoid networks. There is a recent trend towards cross-comparisons among network types and also to take a more mechanistic, as opposed to phenomenological, perspective. For example, analysis of network configurations, such as compartments, allows us to explore the role of co-evolution in structuring mutualistic networks and host-parasitoid networks, and of body size in food webs. 3. Research into ecological networks has recently undergone a renaissance, leading to the production of a new catalogue of evermore complete, taxonomically resolved, and quantitative data. Novel topological patterns have been unearthed and it is increasingly evident that it is the distribution of interaction strengths and the configuration of complexity, rather than just its magnitude, that governs network stability and structure. 4. Another significant advance is the growing recognition of the importance of individual traits and behaviour: interactions, after all, occur between individuals. The new generation of high-quality networks is now enabling us to move away from describing networks based on species-averaged data and to start exploring patterns based on individuals. Such refinements will enable us to address more general ecological questions relating to foraging theory and the recent metabolic theory of ecology. 5. We conclude by suggesting a number of 'dead ends' and 'fruitful avenues' for future research into ecological networks. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors.},

The first official use of biological methods was in the 1970 National River Pollution Survey by the Department of the Environment. Following criticism regarding the adequacy of the method used, the Department set up the Biological Monitoring Working Party (BMWP) to recommend a system for use in national river pollution surveys. This paper reviews the proceedings of the working group, which led to the recommendation of a "score" system based on benthic macro-invertebrates. The outcome of the working group's deliberations regarding levels of identification, abundance, zonation and method of sampling are recorded. The principles by which the scores were allocated to the different families and the reason for having different scores for eroding and depositing substrata samples are explained. The hitherto unpublished explanation is provided for the significant differences between the score system used in the 1980 and subsequent River Pollution Surveys and that recommended in the Final Report of BMWP.},

abstract = {The effects of noise reduction of six tree belts were examined. An amplifier was placed in front of each tree belt, while a noise meter was placed at various heights and distances behind the tree belt. Net noise reduction effect termed as "relative attenuation" was obtained by subtracting the sound pressure level at each measurement site behind the tree belt from the sound pressure level at equal distances over open ground. Five parameters, including visibility, height, and width of the tree belt, height of receiver and noise source, and the distance between noise source and receiver, were studied. A multiple regression model demonstrating the order of importance of the five parameters in relation to relative attenuation was developed. The five parameters were then transformed into three-dimensionless parameters, i.e., h′: receiver and noise source height/tree height, d′: distance between noise source and receiver/tree height, and m′: belt width/visibility. By plotting the relative attenuation on the coordinate axis of h′, d′ and m′ and curve fitting, a three-dimensionless map of noise reduction by tree belts was formed. The map can be used as guidance in designing three belts for noise reduction in environmental planning. {\textcopyright}2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Natural phytoplankton were incubated in situ with the addition of four artificial nutrient sources (phosphate, nitrogen as nitrate+ammonium, silicate, a mixture of all nutrients) and natural nutrient sources (rain water and river water). In both experiments additions of phosphate and the mixture of all nutrients had the most profound effects on biomass increase and on production of particulate and dissolved organic matter. Bacterial biomass and production increased shortly after nutrient addition while phytoplankton passed over a 2-3 day lag phase. Size-fractionated primary production showed the largest enhancement in the {\textgreater}10 mu m and 2-10 mu m size fractions, while picoplanktonic cyanobacteria were outcompeted. The rates of released extracellular organic carbon (EOC) and the percentage of extracellular release (PER) were higher in the first experiment.

abstract = {The pattern of predator-prey interactions is thought to be a key determinant of ecosystem processes and stability. Complex ecological networks are characterized by distributions of interaction strengths that are highly skewed, with many weak and few strong interactors present. Theory suggests that this pattern promotes stability as weak interactors dampen the destabilizing potential of strong interactors. Here, we present an experimental test of this hypothesis and provide empirical evidence that the loss of weak interactors can destabilize communities in nature. We ranked 10 marine consumer species by the strength of their trophic interactions. We removed the strongest and weakest of these interactors from experimental food webs containing {\textgreater}100 species. Extinction of strong interactors produced a dramatic trophic cascade and reduced the temporal stability of key ecosystem process rates, community diversity and resistance to changes in community composition. Loss of weak interactors also proved damaging for our experimental ecosystems, leading to reductions in the temporal and spatial stability of ecosystem process rates, community diversity, and resistance. These results highlight the importance of conserving species to maintain the stabilizing pattern of trophic interactions in nature, even if they are perceived to have weak effects in the system.},

We investigated the existence of patterns in population structure and dispersal within this region, using microsatellite loci extracted from non-invasive sources of DNA. Our results indicate that dispersal and thus gene flow between the groups of chimpanzees at the Park and Reserve is limited, at least more so than it is within the Park, and we identified a biased sex ratio at the Reserve, forewarning of potential conservation concerns in relation to demographic and genetic stochasticity. We discuss conservation actions that may be applicable to sustaining the population within Ngel Nyaki Forest Reserve. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {How ecological communities react to species extinctions is a long-standing yet current question in ecology. The species constituting the basic units of ecosystems interact with each other forming complex networks of trophic relationships and the characteristics of these networks are highly important for the consequences of species extinction. Here we take a more general approach and analyze a broad range of network characteristics and their role in determining food web susceptibility to secondary extinctions. We extend previous studies, that have focused on the consequences of topological and dynamical food web parameters for food web robustness, by also defining network-wide characteristics depending on the relationships between the distribution of species body masses and other species characteristics. We use a bioenergetic dynamical model to simulate realistically structured model food webs that differ in their structural and dynamical properties as well as their size structure. In order to measure food web robustness we calculated the proportion of species going secondarily extinct. A multiple regression analysis was then used to fit a general model relating the proportion of species going secondarily extinct to the measured food web properties. Our results show that there are multiple factors from all three groups of food web characteristics that affect food web robustness. However, we find the most striking effect was related to the body mass–abundance relationship which points to the importance of body mass relationships for food web stability. Zusammenfassung Die Frage nach den Konsequenzen des Artensterbens f{\"{u}}r {\"{o}}kologische Gemeinschaften ist eine aktuelle Frage, die {\"{O}}kologen seit langer Zeit besch{\"{a}}ftigt. Arten bilden die Grundeinheiten der {\"{O}}kosysteme: sie interagieren untereinander und bilden dadurch komplexe Netzwerke. Trophische Beziehungen innerhalb dieser Netzwerke und generelle Netzwerkeigenschaften sind entscheidend f{\"{u}}r die Folgen des Artensterbens. In dieser Studie besch{\"{a}}ftigen wir uns mit einem generellen Ansatz, um eine breite Palette von Netzwerkeigenschaften und deren Rolle f{\"{u}}r sekund{\"{a}}res Artensterben innerhalb von Nahrungsnetzen zu analysieren. Vorherige Studien besch{\"{a}}ftigten sich entweder mit topologischen Parametern oder simulierten dynamisch kleinere Nahrungsnetz-Modulen. Unsere Studie kombiniert beide Ans{\"{a}}tze und erweitert das Modell um die Abh{\"{a}}ngigkeit der Parameter von K{\"{o}}rpermassen. Wir benutzen dabei ein bioenergetisches Modell und simulieren realistisch strukturierte Nahrungsnetze. Dabei liegt der Fokus auf einer realistischen K{\"{o}}rpergr{\"{o}}{\ss}enverteilung der Arten, sowie auf realistischen Annahmen bez{\"{u}}glich struktureller, dynamischer Aspekte. Die Robustheit der Nahrungsnetze ist zu verstehen als der Anteil der sekund{\"{a}}ren Aussterbeereignisse, die ausgel{\"{o}}st werden durch das systematische prim{\"{a}}re Aussterben. Dabei wird nacheinander jeweils eine Art aus dem Netz entfernt, bis jede Art einmal entfernt wurde. Um den Einfluss einzelner Netzwerkfaktoren auf sekund{\"{a}}res Aussterben zu identifizieren, benutzten wir hier ein multiples Regressionsmodell. Es zeigt sich, dass Faktoren aus drei unterschiedlichen Gruppen (topologisch, dynamisch, allometrisch korreliert) die Robustheit von Nahrungsnetzen beeinflussen. Der Zusammenhang zwischen Abundanzen und K{\"{o}}rpermassen, der die Artgemeinschaften charakterisiert, zeigte interessanterweise den st{\"{a}}rksten Effekt auf die sekund{\"{a}}re Aussterberate.},

abstract = {Objective: The elderly population is steadily increasing in the modern world. The aging of the population has led to an increase in geriatric trauma. Elderly trauma patients present unique challenges and face more significant obstacles in recovery compared to younger patients. This study is designed to determine the epidemiologic data of trauma in elderly patients and to contribute to the national trauma database. Materials and Methods: We prospectively collected the data of trauma patients, aged 65 and older, presenting to our Emergency Department. Patients' data, including demographic data, diagnosis, prognosis, trauma scores [Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Injury Severity Score (ISS)], mortality, body regions of injury and outcomes were analyzed. Results: During the study period, 407 patients, of whom 63.9{\%} were males and 36.1{\%} females, were admitted to our Emergency Department. The mean age of the patients was 73.14±7.14 years. Falls (59{\%}) accounted for the most common cause of injury. The mean GCS and mean ISS were 14.39 and 10.69, respectively. Trauma to extremities was the most frequent body region of injury (56.3{\%}). A total of 149 patients were hospitalized. The mean hospital length of stay was 11.07±14 days. The mortality rate was found to be 6.4{\%}. Head trauma was the most common cause in mortality. Conclusions: The risk of trauma in the elderly population is higher. As a result of the decrease in physiological reserve and lack of adaptation to trauma, elderly trauma patients require more aggressive management and a multidisciplinary approach. Further studies are needed for data of elderly trauma patients.},

abstract = {In the face of climate change, populations have two survival options − they can remain in situ and tolerate the new climatic conditions (“stay”), or they can move to track their climatic niches (“go”). For sessile and small-stature organisms like alpine plants, staying requires broad climatic tolerances, realized niche shifts due to changing biotic interactions, acclimation through plasticity, or rapid genetic adaptation. Going, in contrast, requires good dispersal and colonization capacities. Neither the magnitude of climate change experienced locally nor the capacities required for staying/going in response to climate change are constant across landscapes, and both aspects may be strongly affected by local microclimatic variation associated with topographic complexity. We combine ideas from population and community ecology to discuss the effects of topographic complexity in the landscape on the immediate “stay” or “go” opportunities of local populations and communities, and on the selective pressures that may have shaped the stay or go capacities of the species occupying contrasting landscapes. We demonstrate, using example landscapes of different topographical complexity, how species' thermal niches could be distributed across these landscapes, and how these, in turn, may affect many population and community ecological processes that are related to adaptation or dispersal. Focusing on treeless alpine or Arctic landscapes, where temperature is expected to be a strong determinant, our theorethical framework leads to the hypothesis that populations and communities of topographically complex (rough and patchy) landscapes should be both more resistant and more resilient to climate change than those of topographically simple (flat and homogeneous) landscapes. Our theorethical framework further points to how meta-community dynamics such as mass effects in topographically complex landscapes and extinction lags in simple landscapes, may mask and delay the long-term outcomes of these landscape differences under rapidly changing climates.},

abstract = {We have very briefly enumerated a small part of the sum total of the work and ideas about the nature of growth. In trying to gather up the loose ends in a survey on so controversial a subject, one has to be extremely guarded since very little is generally accepted fact. It is conceived by many, however, that growth consists of two large processes, cell division, and differentiation. These have their expression in the two great properties of life, morphology and function. The cause for cell division is intimately tied up with the problem of life and is therefore a physicochemical one possibly due to an attempt on the part of cells to reach chemical and physical equilibrium both with respect to their internal economy and to their environment. It is agreed that cells are potentially immortal in their innate ability to go on dividing ad infinitum and that the reason for cessation of growth and its coincident senescence lies in the production of growth inhibiting substances during the life process. Differentiation itself has an inhibitory effect on the rate of growth, but this may be due to the fact that differentiation permits accumulation of the inhibitory products of metabolism. Differentiation, the process in development which makes variation in function possible, is the result of protoplasmic or organismic pattern, heredity, supplemented by the effects of environment, according to some biologists. Study of growth rates, while demonstrating marked similarities between different animals and even plants, has been complicated by so many variables in its computation that up to the present time no undisputed law of growth can be stated. The factors complicating the problem are, individual variation; different growth rates in the various parts and organs of the body; nutritional factors such as amount of food, vitamins, amino-acids, and mineral salts; endocrine factors; heredity; environmental influences such as temperature, sunshine, atmosphere, season of the year and socio-economic status; and disease processes. Whether the growth rate will be proved to be dependent on the law of compound interest, on that of populations, or on that of an autocatalyzed chemical reaction, or upon some other natural law is for the future to decide. {\textcopyright} 1933 The C.

abstract = {Most climate change predictions omit species interactions and interspecific variation in dispersal. Here, we develop a model of multiple competing species along awarming climatic gradient that includes temperaturedependent competition, differences in niche breadth and interspecific differences in dispersal ability. Competition and dispersal differences decreased diversity and produced so-called 'no-analogue' communities, defined as a novel combination of species that does not currently co-occur. Climate change altered community richness the most when species had narrow niches, when mean community-wide dispersal rates were low and when species differed in dispersal abilities. With high interspecific dispersal variance, the best dispersers tracked climate change, out-competed slower dispersers and caused their extinction. Overall, competition slowed the advance of colonists into newly suitable habitats, creating lags in climate tracking. We predict that climate change will most threaten communities of species that have narrow niches (e.g. tropics), vary in dispersal (most communities) and compete strongly. Current forecasts probably underestimate climate change impacts on biodiversity by neglecting competition and dispersal differences. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Introduction By structural instability we mean a sensitivity of the structure of ecological communities to changes in biological or ecological parameters – including external pressures – that is so high that small pressures or changes in the environment can have such large effects on the community that they lead to species extinctions (Rossberg, 2013; Rohr et al., 2014). Since sensitivity increases with species richness in complex communities (Novak et al., 2011), structural instability imposes, at least in principle, a limit to local species richness. There is good evidence, discussed below, that structural instability does indeed determine local species richness: the number of species in a community increases through invasions to the point where it becomes structurally unstable, and then cannot increase much more because the invasion of any further species leads to the extinction of another species on average. Structural instability unifies, among others, observations of high sensitivity of complex food-web models, made prominent by Yodzis (1988), with observations of difficulties in getting species to coexist with reasonable abundances in empirically parameterized food webs, perhaps first reported by Andersen and Ursin (1977). We shall briefly review these lines of thought below. The ecological concept of structural instability describes a phenomenon that is, in principle, just an instance of particularly high sensitivity. Indeed, Flora et al. (2011) coined the term structural sensitivity for a closely related but different concept (small changes in the functional representation of processes in a model lead to large changes in attractors). Ecological structural instability is closely related to but different from the mathematical concept known as “structural instability” in dynamical systems theory (infinitesimal changes in flow fields lead to large changes in flow trajectories). Indeed, this mathematical concept (Pugh and Peixoto, 2008), which is narrower than the ecological understanding, has also been employed in the context of community ecology (Mesz{\'{e}}na et al., 2006). Despite this ambiguity, the established laxer understanding of “structural instability” in ecology (Rossberg, 2013; Rohr et al., 2014) is adequate, because it captures the important role the phenomenon plays among many other forms of instability in the diversity–stability debate (Ives and Carpenter, 2007). While a good mathematical understanding of structural instability and of the reasons why it is common in ecology is now emerging (Rossberg, 2013; Rohr et al., 2014), we consider it too early to decide which specific, rigorous mathematical definition is the most useful for ecology.},

abstract = {Ecologists have long suspected that species are more likely to interact if their traits match in a particular way. For example, a pollination interaction may be more likely if the proportions of a bee's tongue fit a plant's flower shape. Empirical estimates of the importance of trait-matching for determining species interactions, however, vary significantly among different types of ecological networks. Here, we show that ambiguity among empirical trait-matching studies may have arisen at least in parts from using overly simple statistical models. Using simulated and real data, we contrast conventional generalized linear models (GLM) with more flexible Machine Learning (ML) models (Random Forest, Boosted Regression Trees, Deep Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, na{\"{i}}ve Bayes, and k-Nearest-Neighbor), testing their ability to predict species interactions based on traits, and infer trait combinations causally responsible for species interactions. We found that the best ML models can successfully predict species interactions in plant–pollinator networks, outperforming GLMs by a substantial margin. Our results also demonstrate that ML models can better identify the causally responsible trait-matching combinations than GLMs. In two case studies, the best ML models successfully predicted species interactions in a global plant–pollinator database and inferred ecologically plausible trait-matching rules for a plant–hummingbird network from Costa Rica, without any prior assumptions about the system. We conclude that flexible ML models offer many advantages over traditional regression models for understanding interaction networks. We anticipate that these results extrapolate to other ecological network types. More generally, our results highlight the potential of machine learning and artificial intelligence for inference in ecology, beyond standard tasks such as image or pattern recognition.},

The extinction of species that feed on or are fed on by many others (i.e. 'hubs') has traditionally been thought to cause the greatest threat of further biodiversity loss. Very little attention has been paid to the strength of those feeding links (i.e. link weight) and the prevalence of indirect interactions. Here, we used a dynamical model based on empirical energy budget data to assess changes in ecosystem stability after simulating the loss of species according to various extinction scenarios. Link weight and/or indirect effects had stronger effects on food-web stability than the simple removal of 'hubs', demonstrating that both quantitative fluxes and species dissipating their effects across many links should be of great concern in biodiversity conservation, and the potential for 'hubs' to act as keystone species may have been exaggerated to date.},

abstract = {Imitation is a cornerstone of human development, serving both a cognitive function (e.g. in the acquisition and transmission of skills and knowledge) and a social–communicative function, whereby the imitation of familiar actions serves to maintain social interaction and promote prosociality. In nonhuman primates, this latter function is poorly understood, or even claimed to be absent. In this observational study, we documented interactions between chimpanzees and zoo visitors and found that the two species imitated each other at a similar rate, corresponding to almost 10{\%} of all produced actions. Imitation appeared to accomplish a social–communicative function, as cross-species interactions that contained imitative actions lasted significantly longer than interactions without imitation. In both species, physical proximity promoted cross-species imitation. Overall, imitative precision was higher among visitors than among chimpanzees, but this difference vanished in proximity contexts, i.e. in the indoor environment. Four of five chimpanzees produced imitations; three of them exhibited comparable imitation rates, despite large individual differences in level of cross-species interactivity. We also found that chimpanzees evidenced imitation recognition, yet only when visitors imitated their actions (as opposed to postures). Imitation recognition was expressed by returned imitation in 36{\%} of the cases, and all four imitating chimpanzees engaged in so-called imitative games. Previously regarded as unique to early human socialization, such games serve to maintain social engagement. The results presented here indicate that nonhuman apes exhibit spontaneous imitation that can accomplish a communicative function. The study raises a number of novel questions for imitation research and highlights the imitation of familiar behaviours as a relevant—yet thus far understudied—research topic.},

abstract = {Animals are distinguished by having guts—organs that must extract nutrients from food and also bar invasion by pathogens. Most guts are colonized by nonpathogenic microorganisms, but the functions of these microbes, or even the reasons why they occur in the gut, vary widely among animals. Sometimes these microorganisms have codiversified with hosts; sometimes they live mostly elsewhere in the environment. Either way, gut microorganisms often benefit hosts. Benefits may reflect evolutionary addiction, whereby hosts incorporate gut microorganisms into normal developmental processes. But benefits often include novel ecological capabilities; for example, many metazoan clades exist by virtue of gut communities enabling new dietary niches. Animals vary immensely in their dependence on gut microorganisms, from lacking them entirely to using them as food or to obligate dependence for development, nutrition, or protection. Many consequences of gut microorganisms for hosts can be ascribed to microbial community processes and the host's ability to shape these processes.Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics, Volume 50 is November 4, 2019.

However, surprisingly few well-resolved food webs allow us to evaluate factors that influence the architecture of species interactions. We constructed a meta food web consisting of 714 invertebrate species collected over 9 years of suction and pitfall sampling campaigns in the Jena Experiment, a long-term grassland biodiversity experiment located in Jena, Germany. We summarize information on the 51,496 potential trophic links, which were established using information on diet specificity and species traits that typically constrain feeding interactions (trophic group, body size, and vertical stratification). The list of species identities, traits, and link-derivation rules will be useful not only for tests of plant diversity effects on food web structure within the Jena Experiment, but also for considering consistent construction of food webs from empirical data, and for comparisons of network structure across ecosystems.

abstract = {Numerous recent studies have tested the effects of plant, pollinator, and predator diversity on primary productivity, pollination, and consumption, respectively. Many have shown a positive relationship, particularly in controlled experiments, but variability in results has emphasized the context-dependency of these relationships. Complementary resource use may lead to a positive relationship between diversity and these processes, but only when a diverse array of niches is available to be partitioned among species. Therefore, the slope of the diversity-function relationship may change across differing levels of heterogeneity, but empirical evaluations of this pattern are lacking. Here we examine three important functions/properties in different real world (i.e., nonexperimental) ecosystems: plant biomass in German grasslands, parasitism rates across five habitat types in coastal Ecuador, and coffee pollination in agroforestry systems in Indonesia. We use general linear and structural equation modeling to demonstrate that the effect of diversity on these processes is context dependent, such that the slope of this relationship increases in environments where limiting resources (soil nutrients, host insects, and coffee flowers, respectively) are spatially heterogeneous. These real world patterns, combined with previous experiments, suggest that biodiversity may have its greatest impact on the functioning of diverse, naturally heterogeneous ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2008 Tylianakis et al.},

abstract = {Climate change alters multiple physical drivers that act concurrently on ecological communities. Evidence suggests widespread non-additive effects between multiple drivers; most of this evidence, however, is based on species-level responses, which is problematic because community responses to environmental change also depend on species interactions. To address this knowledge gap, this study experimentally manipulated two physical drivers and examined the responses of a predator–prey interaction. The two drivers tested are fundamental in intertidal systems: air and water temperatures. The two species were the intertidal dogwhelk, Nucella ostrina, and its barnacle prey, Balanus glandula. The objective was to test alternative hypotheses that air and water warming have additive vs. non-additive effects on the whelk-barnacle interaction. A 14-day mesocosm experiment was conducted in which animals were subjected to one of four temperature treatments: ambient (no temperature manipulation; water 12 °C, air 13 °C), warm water (15 °C), warm air (27 °C), or combined (water 15 °C, air 27 °C). There were two key findings. First, air and water warming non-additively affected interaction strength: warm water mitigated a 35{\%} decrease in mean whelk feeding rate caused by warm air. Second, air warming had contrasting effects on individual growth rates of predator and prey. While whelk growth decreased by {\~{}} 60{\%} in warm air, barnacle growth increased by 47{\%}. These findings suggest that combined air and water warming will benefit barnacle populations more than their whelk predators. This study highlights the value of integrating species performances and interactions to understand how multiple physical drivers may affect community structure.},

abstract = {Theory and experiments demonstrate that the number of species in a local area can determine rates of ecosystem processes, but we know little about how the strength of that control compares with other influences or how it might vary across ecological gradients. Here I report results of a pond mesocosm experiment where consumer (snail) species richness, predation intensity, and nutrient availability were crossed in a full-factorial design. This design allowed a direct comparison of the strength of the different factors on food web properties and ecosystem functioning (i.e., system-level fluxes of energy or matter), and an evaluation of how the factors may interact. Systems with higher snail species richness had greater secondary production, consumer biomass, ecosystem respiration, and macrophyte stem growth, and lower epiphyton and periphyton biomass. However, snail species richness effects on periphyton and epiphyton were context dependent; predators reduced the effect of increasing snail richness on the biomass of attached algae. Species richness effects were most often the result of a biological mechanism (e.g., differential resource use), rather than being solely artifacts of the experimental design (e.g., sampling effects). The effects of nutrient enrichment and predation were mostly predictable from simple food chain models; increases in nutrient availability led to increased algal biomass, primary production, and snail biomass, while predators decreased snail biomass and indirectly augmented algae. Snail species richness effects on the biomass of many functional groups were as strong or stronger than those of a substantial nutrient enrichment or of the addition of a voracious predator (Belostoma flumineum). Nutrient enrichment had the most pronounced effects on several system-level processes (e.g., primary production, sedimentation). Species richness had weaker effects on ecosystem properties than on particular functional groups, probably because of compensatory responses among different producer functional groups. In summary, this experiment suggests that the number of consumer species in a system can have large and meaningful effects on the distribution of biomass in a food web, and that these effects can depend on ecological context. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Models of habitat quality have not been developed for some species, and existing models could be improved by incorporating updated information on wildlife–habitat relationships and habitat variables. We developed a GIS-based habitat suitability index (HSI) model for the Korean water deer (Hydropotes inermis argyropus), which often causes human–wildlife conflicts in the Chungnam Province of Korea because of industrialization and urbanization. The model is based on logistic regression analysis, which addresses the impact of multiple habitat variables, such as habitat components, topographic characteristics, and human disturbances. The model yielded a p-value of.289 ({\$}\chi{\$}2 = 9.672) and 65.4{\%} correct prediction level with the overall observation–prediction comparison data. The model demonstrated that a large portion of the province (61.6{\%}) could be regarded as a poor habitat (mean HSI value of the province = 0.22), while the current habitats of the province could be considered of moderate quality (mean HSI value = 0.31). In addition, the chance of observation of the deer increases as the HSI level increases, which means that the model yields a good predictive power. Lastly, we used the model to produce a habitat suitability map. Our HSI model enabled us to quantify habitat preferences, which could be the basis for decision-making on habitat protection, mitigation, and enhancement of the Korean water deer. The proposed model is also applicable for improving and enhancing the existing management practices, as well as for establishing an effective wildlife protection policy. {\textcopyright}2016 Korean Society for Integrative Biology.},

We used a dynamic model of complex, size‐structured food webs to assess interactive effects on diversity and network structure. We found antagonistic impacts: Warming increases diversity in eutrophic systems and decreases it in oligotrophic systems. These effects interact with the community size structure: Communities of similarly sized species such as parasitoid–host systems are stabilized by warming and destabilized by eutrophication, whereas the diversity of size‐structured predator–prey networks decreases strongly with warming, but decreases only weakly with eutrophication. Nonrandom extinction risks for generalists and specialists lead to higher connectance in networks without size structure and lower connectance in size‐structured communities. Overall, our results unravel interactive impacts of warming and eutrophication and suggest that size structure may serve as an important proxy for predicting the community sensitivity to these global change stressors.},

Two experiments were performed, one in which all model ecosystems were dominated by the macrophyte Elodea nuttallii, and one using systems devoid of macrophytes. In the Elodea-dominated and macrophyte-free model ecosystems, populations of primary producers, herbivores, carnivores and detritivores were indirectly affected via the loss of populations of Arthropoda as a direct result of insecticide application. However, the taxa in which secondary effects were observed differed considerably between these two types of model ecosystem. In macrophyte-dominated systems secondary effects were observed on populations of periphytic algae, the macrophyte Elodea nuttallii, the gastropod Bithynia tentaculata, Turbellaria, and sediment dwelling Oligochaeta. In open water systems it were populations of phytoplankton, the rotators Polyarthra and Asplanchna, bivalves (Sphaeriidae), Hirudinea, sediment dwelling Oligochaeta, and that of the isopod Proasellus coxalis in which secondary effects were observed. In aquatic ecosystems the presence or absence of a well-developed macrophyte vegetation may be a very important characteristic that determines the nature and route of secondary effects induced by pesticides. The differences in secondary effects observed between Elodea-dominated and macrophyte-free model ecosystems indicate that the system's structure and trophic dynamics should be taken into account when predicting ecological effects. {\textcopyright} 1992 Springer-Verlag New York Inc.},

abstract = {There is much concern that the functioning of ecosystems will be affected by human-induced changes in biodiversity, of which land-use change is the most important driver. However, changes in biodiversity may be only one of many pathways through which land use alters ecosystem functioning, and its importance relative to other pathways remains unclear. In particular, although biodiversity-ecosystem function research has focused primarily on grasslands, the increases in agricultural inputs (e.g., fertilization, irrigation) and grazing pressure that drive change in grasslands worldwide have been largely ignored. Here we show that long-term (27-year) manipulations of soil resource availability and sheep grazing intensity caused marked, consistent shifts in grassland plant functional composition and diversity, with cascading (i.e., causal chains of) direct, indirect, and interactive effects on multiple ecosystem functions. Resource availability exerted dominant control over aboveground net primary production (ANPP), both directly and indirectly via shifts in plant functional composition. Importantly, the effects of plant functional diversity and grazing intensity on ANPP shifted from negative to positive as agricultural inputs increased, providing strong evidence that soil resource availability modulates the impacts of plant diversity and herbivory on primary production. These changes in turn altered litter decomposition and, ultimately, soil carbon sequestration, highlighting the relevance of ANPP as a key integrator of ecosystem functioning. Our study reveals how human alterations of bottom-up (resources) and top-down (herbivory) forces together interact to control the functioning of grazing systems, the most extensive land use on Earth. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Our survey of recentprimate journals suggests that the average field study uses 1.5 years of data from 50 animals The models are based on the simple Leslie‐Lefkovitch matrix. They suggest a simple method that allows assessment from a few years'data, of whether a population is collapsing and requires intervention To a good approximation, populations will collapse when adult survival, per inter‐birth interval, is less than 70 percent. Modifications of the basic model incorporate more realistic assumptions about social organization and densitydependent resource limitation. These allow us to identify population densities at which potential Allee effects operate, and permit more precise estimates of the minimum population sizes and compositions required for successful reintroductions to the wild The most important result is that populations of primates that live in small family groups may be more prone to “demographic” extinction than are more promiscuous species that live in more extended groups.

abstract = {The effects of global and local environmental changes are transmitted through networks of interacting organisms to shape the structure of communities and the dynamics of ecosystems. We tested the impact of elevated temperature on the top-down and bottom-up forces structuring experimental freshwater pond food webs in western Canada over 16 months. Experimental warming was crossed with treatments manipulating the presence of planktivorous fish and eutrophication through enhanced nutrient supply. We found that higher temperatures produced top-heavy food webs with lower biomass of benthic and pelagic producers, equivalent biomass of zooplankton, zoo-benthos and pelagic bacteria, and more pelagic viruses. Eutrophication increased the biomass of all organisms studied, while fish had cascading positive effects on periphyton, phytoplankton and bacteria, and reduced biomass of invertebrates. Surprisingly, virus biomass was reduced in the presence of fish, suggesting the possibility for complex mechanisms of top-down control of the lytic cycle. Warming reduced the effects of eutrophication on periphyton, and magnified the already strong effects of fish on phytoplankton and bacteria. Warming, fish and nutrients all increased whole-system rates of net production despite their distinct impacts on the distribution of biomass between producers and consumers, plankton and benthos, and microbes and macrobes. Our results indicate that warming exerts a host of indirect effects on aquatic food webs mediated through shifts in the magnitudes of top-down and bottom-up forcing. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Environmental change can alter species' abundances within communities consistently; for example, increasing all abundances by the same percentage, or more idiosyncratically. Here, we show how comparing effects of temperature on species grown in isolation and when grown together helps our understanding of how ecological communities more generally respond to environmental change. In particular, we find that the shape of the feasibility domain (the parameter space of carrying capacities compatible with positive species' abundances) helps to explain the composition of experimental microbial communities under changing environmental conditions. First, we introduce a measure to quantify the asymmetry of a community's feasibility domain using the column vectors of the corresponding interaction matrix. These column vectors describe the effects each species has on all other species in the community (hereafter referred to as species' multidimensional effects). We show that as the asymmetry of the feasibility domain increases the relationship between species' abundance when grown together and when grown in isolation weakens. We then show that microbial communities experiencing different temperature environments exhibit patterns consistent with this theory. Specifically, communities at warmer temperatures show relatively more asymmetry; thus, the idiosyncrasy of responses is higher compared with that in communities at cooler temperatures. These results suggest that while species' interactions are typically defined at the pairwise level, multispecies dynamics can be better understood by focusing on the effects of these interactions at the community level.},

abstract = {The carbon cycle modulates climate change, via the regulation of atmospheric CO2, and it represents one of the most important services provided by ecosystems. However, considerable uncertainties remain concerning potential feedback between the biota and the climate. In particular, it is unclear how global warming will affect the metabolic balance between the photosynthetic fixation and respiratory release of CO2 at the ecosystem scale. Here, we present a combination of experimental field data from freshwater mesocosms, and theoretical predictions derived from the metabolic theory of ecology to investigate whether warming will alter the capacity of ecosystems to absorb CO2. Our manipulative experiment simulated the temperature increases predicted for the end of the century and revealed that ecosystem respiration increased at a faster rate than primary production, reducing carbon sequestration by 13 per cent. These results confirmed our theoretical predictions based on the differential activation energies of these two processes. Using only the activation energies for whole ecosystem photosynthesis and respiration we provide a theoretical prediction that accurately quantified the precise magnitude of the reduction in carbon sequestration observed experimentally. We suggest the combination of whole-ecosystem manipulative experiments and ecological theory is one of the most promising and fruitful research areas to predict the impacts of climate change on key ecosystem services. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society.},

The number of taxa and their phylogenetic relationships however remain controversial. To address these issues, we analyzed a 1.8kb long fragment of the mitochondrial genome, including the cytochrome b gene, the hypervariable region I of the D-loop and the intermediate tRNAs, from individuals representing nine species. Based on our data, we obtained various well-supported terminal clades, which refer mainly to described taxa. Relationships among these clades are not fully resolved, suggesting at least two radiations in the evolutionary history of the genus. According to divergence age estimates, radiations occurred in the late Miocene and the early to middle Pleistocene. Our findings support the revision of the current classification of the genus Presbytis and enable us to discuss implications for conservation. However, further studies including nuclear sequence data are necessary to completely understand the evolutionary history of the genus, and to address possible hybridization events among taxa.},

abstract = {Social organization involving pair bonding and two-adult groups is rare in mammals. Current sociobiological theory suggests that this grouping and behavior pattern is somewhat anomalous. The gibbons (genus Hylobates) are the only hominoids to exhibit pair bonds and two-adult groups. In this article I present an overview of the current issues in monogamy and pair-bond theory, and review traditional conceptualizations and the accumulated data relevant to gibbon social organization. The significance of hominoid behavioral phylogeny and population-wide studies is also considered. Recent findings indicate that pair-bonding and two-adult groups are not ubiquitous among the hylobatids. Many aspects of gibbon behavior and ecology do not conform to expectations of the conditions under which two-adult groups and/or pair-bonding patterns should evolve. A review of the information available from long-term and short-term studies of gibbons suggests an alternative way of viewing their socioecology. I propose that gibbons currently exist in variable communities that have arisen via ecological pressures and specific behavioral patterns from an ancestral multimale/multi-female grouping pattern. This social organization is not best characterized as "monogamous." This review also suggests that hominoid grouping patterns can be viewed as occurring along a continuum rather than as being discretely different units.},

These rates are approximately two and three times faster than previously reported. The distances moved by species are greatest in studies showing the highest levels of warming, with average latitudinal shifts being generally sufficient to track temperature changes. However, individual species vary greatly in their rates of change, suggesting that the range shift of each species depends on multiple internal species traits and external drivers of change.

We found that home range reporting was generally inadequate for reproducing studies; that the methods employed varied considerably; that home range estimates were often reported and analyzed using inappropriate methods; and that many comparisons were made between studies that may produce spurious results. We urge for minimum editorial standards for reporting home range studies and we urge researchers to follow a unified methodology for estimating animal home ranges.

abstract = {Deriving nearly 90{\%} of its primary energy resources from oil, the State of Hawaii is more dependent on oil than any other U.S. state. The price of electricity in Hawaii is also more than twice the U.S. average. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 directed assessment of the economic implications of Hawaii's oil dependence and the feasibility of using renewable energy to help meet the state's electrical generation and transportation fuel use. This paper is based on the assessments and report prepared in response to that directive. Current total installed electrical capacity for the State of Hawaii is 2,414 MW e, 83{\%} of which is fuel-oil generated, but already including about 170 MW e of renewable capacity. The assessments identified about 2,133 MW e (plus another estimated 2,000 MW e of rooftop PV systems) of potential new renewable energy capacity. Most notable, in addition to the rooftop solar potential, is 750 MW e and 140 MW e of geothermal potential on Hawaii and Maui, respectively, 840 MW e of potential wind capacity, primarily on Lanai and Molokai, and one potential 285 MW e capacity specific solar project (PV or solar thermal) identified on Kauai. Important social, political, and electrical-grid infrastructure challenges would need to be overcome to realize this potential. Among multiple crop and acreage scenarios, biofuels assessment found 360,000 acres in Hawaii zoned for agriculture and appropriate for sugarcane, enough to produce 429 million gallons of ethanol-enough to meet about 64{\%} of current 2005 Hawaiian gasoline use. Tropical oil seed crops-potentially grown on the same land-might meet a substantial portion of current diesel use, but there has been little experience growing such crops in Hawaii. {\textcopyright} 2009 IEEE.},

abstract = {Species ranges are expected to expand along their cooler boundaries in response to rising temperatures associated with current global climate change. However, this 'fingerprint' of climate change is yet to be assessed for an entire flora. Here, we examine patterns of altitudinal range change in the complete native vascular flora of sub-Antarctic Marion Island. We demonstrate a rapid mean upslope expansion in the flora since 1966, in response to 1.2°C warming on the island. The 3.4 ± 0.8 m yr-1 (mean ± SE) upslope expansion rate documented is amongst the highest estimates from partial floras. However, less than half of the species in the flora were responsible for the expansion trend, demonstrating that the global fingerprint of warming may be driven by a highly responsive subset of the species pool. Individual range expansion rates varied greatly, with species-specific niche requirements explaining some of this variation. As a result of the idiosyncratic expansion rates, altitudinal patterns of species richness and community composition changed considerably, with the formation of no-analog communities at high and intermediate altitudes. Therefore, both species- and community-level changes have occurred in the flora of Marion Island over a relatively short period of rapid warming, demonstrating the sensitivity of high latitude communities to climate change. Patterns of change within this flora illustrate the range of variation in species responses to climate change and the consequences thereof for species distributions and community reorganization. {\textcopyright} 2008 The Authors Journal compilation {\textcopyright} 2008 Blackwell Publishing.},

abstract = {Apex predator reintroductions are commonly motivated by the imperative to restore populations and wider ecosystem function by precipitating trophic cascades that release basal species. Yet evidence for the existence of such cascades is often equivocal, particularly where consumptive interactions between apex and intermediate predators are weak or absent. Here, using a tri-trophic skate-crab-bivalve study-system, we find that non-consumptive interactions between apex skate and intermediate crabs cascade down to consumptive interactions between crabs and bivalves, significantly reducing bivalve mortality. However, skate only functioned as keystone where crabs foraged for bivalves in the absence of mature bivalve reef: where reef was present, bivalve mortality was not significantly different in the presence or absence of skate. By facilitating the establishment of basal species which, in turn, diminish apex-intermediate effects, the skate's keystone function is subject to negative regulation. Thus, we propose that keystone functionality can be transient with respect to environmental context. Our findings have two central implications for apex predator reintroductions and basic ecology: (i) species hitherto not considered as keystone may have the capacity to act as such transiently, and; (ii) keystones are known to regulate ecosystems, but transience implies that ecosystems can regulate keystone function.},

abstract = {Predators typically are larger than their prey, and consequently, trophic level should increase with body size. Whereas this relationship has helped in developing predictions about food web structure and dynamics in mesocosms and simple communities, a trophic-level–body-size relationship may not exist for all kinds of communities or taxa, especially those with many non-carnivorous species. Moreover, functional traits associated with trophic level generally have not been considered. Herein, we examine the correlation between trophic level and body size in fishes and how this relationship may vary in relation to functional traits (body dimensions, mouth size and orientation, tooth shape, gill rakers, and gut length) and trophic guilds (carnivorous vs. non-carnivorous). We analyzed data from morphological measurements and dietary analyses performed on thousands of specimens from freshwater and estuarine habitats across three zoogeographic regions (Neartic, Neotropical, and Afrotropical). A positive relationship between trophic level and body size was only found for carnivorous fishes. No relationship was found when all species were analyzed together, rejecting the idea that trophic level is positively related with body size in fishes generally. This result was consistent even when using either body mass or standard length as the measure of body size, and trophic level for either species (average values) or individual specimens as the response variable. At the intraspecific level, trophic level varied consistently with size for one third of the species, among which only 40{\%} had positive relationships. Body depth, tooth shape, and mouth width were all associated with the trophic-level–body-size relationship. Overall, predators with conical or triangular serrated teeth, large mouths, and elongated/and/or fusiform bodies tend to have positive trophic-level–body-size relationships, whereas primarily non-carnivorous species with unicuspid or multicuspid teeth, deep bodies and small to medium sized mouth gapes tended to have negative relationships. Given the diverse ecological strategies encompassed by fishes, trophic level and food web patterns and processes should not be inferred based solely on body size. Research that integrates multiple functional traits with trophic ecology will improve understanding and predictions about food web structure and dynamics.},

abstract = {The prediction of the effects of disturbances in natural systems is limited by the general lack of knowledge on the strength of species interactions, i.e., the effect of one species on the population growth rate of another, and by the uncertainty of the effects that may be manifested via indirect pathways within the food web. Here we explored the consequences of changes in species populations for the remaining species within nine exceptionally wellcharacterized empirical food webs, for which, unlike the vast majority of other published webs, feeding links have been fully quantified. Using the inverse of the Jacobian matrix, we found that perturbations to species with few connections have larger net effects (considering both direct and indirect pathways between two species) on the rest of the food web than do disturbances to species that are highly connected. For 40{\%} of predator-prey links, predators had positive net effects on prey populations, due to the predominance of indirect interactions. Our results highlight the fundamental, but often counterintuitive, role of indirect effects for the maintenance of food web complexity and biodiversity. {\textcopyright} 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.},

The various mountain micro-climates provide a natural gradient for space-for-time substitution research that plant responses to climate change. In this study, we surveyed the plant community in term of species composition, diversity and biomass across 189 sites on a hill of the Tibetan Plateau and analysed the individual and integrated effects of soil temperature and moisture on the plant community. The results showed that, at the quadrat scale, there were decrease in richness of 1.08 species for every 1 °C increase in soil temperature and 3.56 species for every 10{\%} decrease in soil moisture. The integrated effects of increasing soil temperature and decreasing moisture are expected to lead to a rapid decrease in species richness. Biomass had no significant correlation with soil temperature but significantly decreased with soil moisture decreasing (p {\textless} 0.01). Biomass would decrease when soil moisture was below 20{\%}, no matter how the change of soil temperature. We also found that gramineae and perennial forbs were sensitive to climate change. With soil temperature increased, the proportion of gramineae increased, whereas the proportion of perennial forbs decreased. The integrated effects of soil temperature increasing and moisture decreasing caused a shift from sedge-controlled to gramineae-controlled communities in alpine meadow. This study not only enhances our understanding of mountain plant community dynamics under climate change, but also predicts the shift of vegetation response to climate change on high-elevation alpine meadow.},

The Po Delta is of international importance for Mediterranean and Slender-billed Gulls and for Gull-billed, Sandwich, Common and Little Terns, but their vulnerable breeding sites are still unprotected. no conservation scheme has been proposed for Mediterranean seabirds, despite the vulnerability of several species, and the protection of only a limited number of colonies has been undertaken. We propose the following specific guidelines for the conservation of the gull and tern colonies in the Po Delta, based upon a decade of research on habitat requirements and on several vulnerability factors: (1) In the lagoons, necessary measures will include protection from human disturbance, active management against erosion of a complex of islets, maintenance of the habitats preferred by each species, and creation of new islets to increase habitat availability, especially for the terns; (2) The habitat preferred by each species of conservation concern, islets with bare ground or with 30-100{\%} cover of vegetation lower than 20 cm, should be maintained in these lagoons. In particular, islets from 0.1 to 0.8 ha, with every reduced cover, and far from other lands, should be provided for Little Terns. Islets larger than one ha and with a high grass cover, preferred by Yellow-legged Gulls, should be avoided in order to repel this predatory gull. In the main lagoon, the Valli di Comacchio, the existing 26 islets should be doubled in number and the new islets should have characteristics suitable specifically for the terns, which may be limited by habitat availability; (3) On the outer beaches of the delta, the declining population of Little Terns should be protected from human disturbance by temporary reserves on their colony sites.},

More recently, faced with the challenges of conserving migratory species, other problems have gained in importance, such as mapping migratory routes understanding the role of individual and environmental drivers of migration patterns, or estimating the size of trans-continental migratory populations. Our overall aim in this chapter is to discuss how models, combined with modern data sources and statistical methods, can be used to test different hypotheses about the causes of migration. In Sections 8.2-8.4 we structure our presentation around these three essential components (models, data, and inference) and, in Section 8.5 , we illustrate their linkages by means of several case studies.},

abstract = {Few models concern how environmental variables such as temperature affect community structure. Here, we develop a model of how temperature affects food web connectance, a powerful driver of population dynamics and community structure. We use the Arrhenius equation to add temperature dependence of foraging traits to an existing model of food web structure. The model predicts potentially large temperature effects on connectance. Temperature-sensitive food webs exhibit slopes of up to 0.01 units of connectance per 1°C change in temperature. This corresponds to changes in diet breadth of one resource item per 2°C (assuming a food web containing 50 species). Less sensitive food webs exhibit slopes down to 0.0005, which corresponds to about one resource item per 40°C. Relative sizes of the activation energies of attack rate and handling time determine whether warming increases or decreases connectance. Differences in temperature sensitivity are explained by differences between empirical food webs in the body size distributions of organisms. We conclude that models of temperature effects on community structure and dynamics urgently require considerable development, and also more and better empirical data to parameterize and test them. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society.},

It remains unclear, however, how much a community's persistence depends on the identities of the species present, or how much the role played by each species varies as a function of the community in which it is found. We measured species' roles by studying how species are embedded within the overall network and the subsequent dynamic implications. Using data from 32 empirical food webs, we find that species' roles and dynamic importance are inherent species attributes and can be extrapolated across communities on the basis of taxonomic classification alone. Our results illustrate the variability of roles across species and communities and the relative importance of distinct species groups when attempting to conserve ecological communities.},

In addition, their behaviour is similar to that of wild gibbons in terms of activity budgets, position in the canopy, body posture, pair association (PA) and diet. Prior to this study, no attempt has been made to quantify the rehabilitation process for gibbons, and rehabilitation project personnel require data reporting all aspects of a release so that improvements can be made. It is important to report these data for the beneWt of future releases.

By overlaying these distribution maps in a information system, we created maps that revealed the most be a tropical wet evergreen forest in central-eastern East Indonesia, in which 11 species coexisted. No other studies had so far identified this region as a biodiversity hotspot. Generally, the states of Sabah and Sarawak are considered richest in general species diversity. We suggest that the main reason for this is the low number biodiversity studies that have been conducted in Indonesian Borneo with Malaysian Borneo and a focus in biodiversity studies on mountain rather than lowlands. We used two alternative taxonomic Bornean primates, one based on a biological and the other on a species concept, to determine whether the outcome of hotspot depended on taxonomic classification. The location of endemic primate hotspots depended on the choice of species concept, whereas the hotspots of primate species richness was not affected by choice concept. Our results suggest that a hotspot identification based on a relatively small group of taxa can vary with the group of species investigation and their taxonomic classifications. Because of the congruence between fine-scale hotspots of Bornean primate diversity hotspots reported in the literature, Bornean primates appear identifying areas of general species richness. Bornean primates may, be useful indicators of lowland diversity on the island.},

abstract = {Continental-scale assembly of floras results from past and present in situ diversification in association with several external processes. Among these processes are the making and breaking of connections among landmasses. Connections among landmasses are constantly in flux as are the climates and landscapes along the connection corridors, so that these corridors, or land bridges, may either facilitate or restrict migration at a given time. Across land bridges, changing landscape-level and organismal factors include the dispersal potential and vectors of propagules, competition, predation, and distributions altered by pathogens. Assembly of a flora is, therefore, the outcome of complex, interacting, temporally-varying factors that render simplistic explanations unlikely. In the case of North America, the continent experienced ephemeral connections with adjacent regions via five land bridges over the last 100 Ma at different times and under different climates and specific landscape morphologies, including edaphic characteristics. Here, I emphasize the earliest of these connections, Beringia, which probably comprised an initially-incomplete land bridge during the Cretaceous and Paleocene resulting from compression, fragmentation, and rotation of Asian-North American sub-blocks as North America began moving westward from the northern portion of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. During the same time, additional land was added to Beringia with accretion of terranes and the subduction of the northern edge of the Pacific Plate beneath the North American-Asian Plates in the Eocene to form the Aleutian Islands. Other connections between North America and adjacent landmasses were the North Atlantic, the Antilles, Central America, and the Magellan land bridge.},

This is exemplified by a recent dataset on free ranging snub-nosed monkeys (Rhinopithecus bieti) in Northwest Yunnan, China. Our findings show that the grid cell method cannot substitute for the minimum convex polygon (MCP) method and vice versa. MCP-based estimates are far too large, especially when the form of the home range is irregular due to forays into peripheral areas. Here, we propose an adjusted polygon method, whereby unsuitable and never visited areas are clipped out from the polygon, thus producing more accurate results. Compared to the grid cell method, the adjusted MCP is much more robust when the number of group relocations is limited; MCP turned out to be the method of choice for calculation of monthly and seasonal home ranges. The grid cell method on the other hand yielded the most precise estimates for total or annual home ranges. The style of ranging exhibited by a given primate taxon or population determines which analytical procedures should be applied to estimate home range size, and we would stress the need for thorough evaluation of the pros and cons of home range estimators before conducting field work and analysing data.},

abstract = {Background: Research regarding zoonotic diseases often focuses on infectious diseases animals have given to humans. However, an increasing number of reports indicate that humans are transmitting pathogens to animals. Recent examples include methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, influenza A virus, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Ascaris lumbricoides. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of published literature regarding reverse zoonoses and highlight the need for future work in this area. Methods: An initial broad literature review yielded 4763 titles, of which 4704 were excluded as not meeting inclusion criteria. After careful screening, 56 articles (from 56 countries over three decades) with documented human-to-animal disease transmission were included in this report. Findings: In these publications, 21 (38{\%}) pathogens studied were bacterial, 16 (29{\%}) were viral, 12 (21{\%}) were parasitic, and 7 (13{\%}) were fungal, other, or involved multiple pathogens. Effected animals included wildlife (n = 28, 50{\%}), livestock (n = 24, 43{\%}), companion animals (n = 13, 23{\%}), and various other animals or animals not explicitly mentioned (n = 2, 4{\%}). Published reports of reverse zoonoses transmission occurred in every continent except Antarctica therefore indicating a worldwide disease threat. Interpretation: As we see a global increase in industrial animal production, the rapid movement of humans and animals, and the habitats of humans and wild animals intertwining with great complexity, the future promises more opportunities for humans to cause reverse zoonoses. Scientific research must be conducted in this area to provide a richer understanding of emerging and reemerging disease threats. As a result, multidisciplinary approaches such as One Health will be needed to mitigate these problems. {\textcopyright} 2014 Messenger et al.},

There exist some encouraging applications, but few details are known about the relationships between centrality measurements and trophic levels. In addition, these studies almost refer to unweighted trophic networks, despite the acknowledged need of investigating weighted webs. Here we aim to contribute to the synthetic treatment of these complementary issues by analyzing several indices of centrality and trophic level. Studying 19 ecosystems, we ranked the nodes according to their positional importance values (based on various centrality indices) and we compared the rank order of coefficients with unweighted or weighted trophic levels. Our goal was revealing potential biases in finding high centrality nodes among basal, intermediate and top species. We found that key species occupy intermediate positions of the trophic hierarchy. In case of unweighted data, trophic levels of key nodes do not deviate from trends displayed by the whole dataset. Significant differences were observed when using weighted data. These results contradict the common belief of many ecologists that identified top-predators and charismatic megafauna as main targets of conservation policies. We discuss the potential consequences of the observed features on ecosystem dynamics.},

abstract = {Rising temperatures likely affect the trophic interactions in temperate regions as global warming progresses. An open question is how a temperature rise may affect consumer pressure and plant abundance in shallow aquatic ecosystems, where most consumers are omnivorous. Interestingly, herbivory (plant-eating) is more prevalent toward low latitudes in ectotherms such as fish and aquatic invertebrates, and this may be temperature driven. We used pond snails (Lymnaea stagnalis L.) as a model aquatic ectotherm species and tested their consumption of both animal prey (Gammarus pulex L.) and plant material (Potamogeton lucens L.) at three different temperatures (15, 20, and 25°C). Higher temperatures led to higher consumption rates by the omnivore on both plant food and animal prey when fed separately. When the food was offered simultaneously, the pond snails consistently preferred animal prey over plant material at all tested temperatures. However, the omnivore did consume plant material even though they had enough animal prey available to them. Based on our experiments, we conclude that with increasing temperatures, L. stagnalis will only increase their consumption rates but not change food preference. Further studies are needed to test the generality of our findings across aquatic species to predict the effect of warming on aquatic plant consumption.},

How do they move and interbreed across the landscape? How were they moving a thousand years ago, and where were the ancestors of a particular individual alive today? Answers to these questions can have profound consequences for our understanding of history, ecology, and the evolutionary process. In this review, we discuss how geographic aspects of the distribution, movement, and reproduction of organisms are reflected in their pedigree across space and time. Because the structure of the pedigree is what determines patterns of relatedness in modern genetic variation, our aim is to thus provide intuition for how these processes leave an imprint in genetic data.

abstract = {This chapter analyzes the benefits and shortcomings of inferring a temporal trend from a study of different aged sites. This technique, called space-for-time substi- tution, assumes that spatial and temporal variation are equivalent. Although this assumption has been challenged, studies continue to rely on space-for-time sub- stitution due to necessity or convenience. To evaluate the utility and soundness of space-for-time substitution, I review a variety of studies. Studies of vegetation succession illustrate the generalizing power of space-for-time substitution, but point out the power of direct long-term studies for exposing mechanisms. Space-for-time substitution was initially justi- fied by a deterministic theory of succession, but long-term studies have helped replace that theory. Other systems show a different balance between long-term studies and space- for-time substitution. The utility of space-for-time substitution to generate hypotheses about pattern and mechanism is shown in marine upwelling systems. In a chronosequence of strip-mined sites, space-for-time substitution erroneously suggested a succession; historical factors explained much of the temporal pat- tern. Certain forecasts of acidification and recovery of surface waters are subject to the limitations of space-for-time substitution, as is the quantification of other regimes of stress and disturbance. Much of the problem in evaluating space-for-time substitution lies in using time as a surrogate for the past environment and prior system status. Improved determination of the history of sites constituting a chronosequence can help assess the validity of space-for-time substitution. However, certain transient effects can only be determined via long-term studies. Determination of history can also improve understanding of systems not usually considered to have a significant time dimension. For example, debris dams and organic storage in streams introduce a past to certain aquatic systems. The impact of temporal differences in fish recruitment can cascade through trophic webs in lakes and affect productivity over the long term. In summary, space-for-time substitution has been successful where general or qualitative trends are sought, or when hypotheses are to be generated. It has failed where unrecognized effects in the past of a system were oflarge magnitude. Space-for-time substitution has appeared to be irrelevant where the past has had unsuspected effects. Analysis of the influence of past environments or prior system status is needed to justify space-for-time substitution, link short- and long-term studies, and frame and interpret direct long-term studies. The two techniques are not strict alternatives.},

abstract = {As participation in outdoor recreational activities escalates, land managers struggle to develop management policies that ensure coexistence of wildlife and recreation. However, this requires an understanding of how wildlife responds to various forms of recreational activities and the spatial context in which the activities occur. Therefore, we measured responses of 2 species of grassland songbirds, one species of forest songbird, and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) exposed to a pedestrian, a pedestrian accompanied by a dog on leash, and a dog alone (only for grassland birds, on and away from recreational trails. We assessed the "area of influence" for each treatment by determining the probability that an animal would flush or become alert (for mule deer only) given its perpendicular distance to a trait or a line of movement in areas without trails. When animals were disturbed, we measured flush distance (the distance between the disturbance and the animal when flushed), distance moved, and, for mule deer, alert distance the distance between the disturbance and the deer when it became alert). For all species, area of influence, flush distance, distance moved, and alert distance (for mule deer) was greater when activities occurred off-trail versus on-trail. Generally, among on-trail and off-trail treatments in grasslands for vesper sparrows (Pooecetes gramineus) and western meadowlarks (Sturnella neglecta), the smallest area of influence and shortest flush distance and distance moved resulted from the dog-alone treatment, and these responses were greater for the pedestrian-alone and dog-on-leash treatments. In forests, for American robins (Turdus migratorius), the area of influence, flush distance, and distance moved did not generally differ between the pedestrian-alone and dog-on-leash treatments. For mule deer, presence of a dog resulted in a greater area of influence, alert and flush distance, and distance moved than when a pedestrian was alone. Natural lands managers can implement spatial and behavioral restrictions in visitor management to reduce disturbance by recreational activities on wildlife. Restrictions on types of activities allowed in some areas such as prohibiting dogs or restricting use to trails will aid in minimizing disturbance. Additionally, managers can restrict the number and spatial arrangement of trails so that sensitive areas or habitats are avoided},

abstract = {How many dimensions (trait-axes) are required to predict whether two species interact? This unanswered question originated with the idea of ecological niches, and yet bears relevance today for understanding what determines network structure. Here, we analyse a set of 200 ecological networks, including food webs, antagonistic and mutualistic networks, and find that the number of dimensions needed to completely explain all interactions is small ({\textless} 10), with model selection favouring less than five. Using 18 high-quality webs including several species traits, we identify which traits contribute the most to explaining network structure. We show that accounting for a few traits dramatically improves our understanding of the structure of ecological networks. Matching traits for resources and consumers, for example, fruit size and bill gape, are the most successful combinations. These results link ecologically important species attributes to large-scale community structure. {\textcopyright} 2013 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {Introduction The dynamical behavior of individuals in ecosystems involves a multifaceted set of interaction types and processes that take place at different hierarchical levels. We present an individual-based, stochastic model that considers species dynamics at three hierarchical levels: population, community, and metacommunity. We use an individual-based model to show how the consequences of mechanisms that are specific to each hierarchical level may interact with processes that belong to other hierarchical levels. The strength of these effects is quantified in terms of impacts on metapopulation sizes and spatial distribution of populations. Results indicate the following: (1) the cohesion of the social network structure among conspecific individuals heavily affects their feeding efficiency at food-web level; (2) more generalist feeding habits trigger homogeneous spatial distribution of species at the landscape scale; and (3) high frequency of migration movements limits the local success of a generalist species thus leading to small metapopulation sizes. We illustrate how such a hierarchical framework may contribute to understanding the emergence of macroscopic patterns (i.e., metapopulation size and spatial heterogeneity) starting from elementary, bottom–up rules defined at the individual level. Hierarchical Organization and Individual-Based Modeling in Ecology Concurrent processes and interactions occur at different hierarchical levels in ecosystems (i.e., individual, population, community, and metapopulation/metacommunity) and do often spread their effects beyond the levels in which they actually originate. Some studies describe how ecological dynamics involving two hierarchical layers may interplay with each other. Social interactions among conspecific individuals may be regulated by metapopulation and community dynamics, community composition may be molded by landscape fragmentation, and species coexistence in metacommunities may result from the trade-off between spatial dispersal and multiple interaction types in food webs. Association rates in a population of wild Asian elephants depend on environmental conditions and seasonality (de Silva et al., 2011). The rates at which social ties are formed peak in dry periods and resident elephants tend to maintain over time a stable pool of interactions with the same individuals. The cohesion of social groups of baboons may vary in response to predation pressure or spatial food distribution (Barton et al., 1996). When predation pressure is high, the distances between conspecific individuals are smaller and social groups are more cohesive; this raises the chances of contest competition.},

@article{Sanders2015,
abstract = {Species extinction rates due to human activities are high [1-3], and initial extinctions can trigger cascades of secondary extinctions, leading to further erosion of biodiversity [4]. A potential major mechanism for secondary extinction cascades is provided by the long-standing theory that the diversity of consumer species is maintained due to the positive indirect effects that these species have on each other by reducing competition among their respective resource species [5-7]. This means that the loss of one carnivore species could lead to competitive exclusion at the prey trophic level, leading to extinctions of further carnivore species. Evidence for these effects is difficult to obtain due to many confounding factors in natural systems, but extinction cascades that could be due to this mechanism have been demonstrated in simplified laboratory microcosms [8]. We established complex insect food webs in replicated field mesocosms and found that the overharvesting of one parasitoid wasp species caused increased extinction rates of other parasitoid species, compared to controls, but only when we manipulated the spatial distribution of herbivore species such that the potential for interspecific competition at this level was high. This provides clear evidence for horizontal extinction cascades at high trophic levels due to the proposed mechanism. Our results demonstrate that the loss of carnivores can have widespread effects on other species at the same trophic level due to indirect population-dynamic effects that are rarely considered in this context.},

abstract = {We assessed the effects of quality and quantity of prey species on the growth of Little Tern Sterna albifrons chicks raised in salinas (salt-pans), Algarve, Portugal. An energetic balance model was developed, which estimated the total amount of energy ingested by all chicks in a nest and the energy expenditure by the chicks when either growing alone or in groups of two and three per nest. Energy intake per chick depended on the energy available per nest and a competition value for food between chicks. Energy expenditure was defined by the basal metabolic rate (BMR), which depends on chick's weight, plus a multiple of BMR, obtained by calibration and accounting for unspecified energetic losses. Prey species ingested by Little Tern chicks were mainly the fishes sandsmelt Atherina spp., Sardine Sardina pilchardus, Garfish Belone belone and mummichog Fundulus spp., but also two types of shrimp (Paleomonetes spp. and Paleomon spp.). Although prey species more abundant in salinas (shrimps and Fundulus spp.) were delivered at a higher rate, and Fundulus spp. had the greatest calorific content, chick growth was more sensitive to alterations in the ingestion of typically marine fish species, such as Sardina pilchardus and Belone belone. Model predictions were in agreement with data obtained in the field, as adults breeding in salinas foraged regularly at sea. Practical considerations from the present results are: (1) birds breeding in salinas rely on a sufficient amount of typically marine prey to ensure the growth of their chicks; (2) in some years foraging conditions in the salinas can be favourable, apparently because high food abundance (plus proximity to nests) may compensate for relatively poor quality of food types encountered.},

abstract = {A family of graph-theoretical algorithms based on the minimal spanning tree are capable of detecting several kinds of cluster structure in arbitrary point sets; description of the detected clusters is possible in some cases by extensions of the method. Development of these clustering algorithms was based on examples from two-dimensional space because we wanted to copy the human perception of gestalts or point groupings. On the other hand, all the methods considered apply to higher dimensional spaces and even to general metric spaces. Advantages of these methods include determinacy, easy interpretation of the resulting clusters, conformity to gestalt principles of perceptual organization, and invariance of results under monotone transformations of interpoint distance. Brief discussion is made of the application of cluster detection to taxonomy and the selection of good feature spaces for pattern recognition. Detailed analyses of several planar cluster detection problems are illustrated by text and figures. The well-known Fisher iris data, in four-dimensional space, have been analyzed by these methods also. Pl/1 programs to implement the minimal spanning tree methods have been fully debugged.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {General Concept Biodiversity is rapidly declining while the frequency and strength of anthropogenically influenced changes in climate and land use is increasing (Chapin et al., 2000; Butchart et al., 2010). A diminished biodiversity leads to a reduced capability of ecological systems, such as individuals, populations, communities, and food webs, to buffer environmental changes and to maintain ecosystem functions and ecosystem services, leading, in turn, to a further decline in biodiversity. This profoundly impacts human well-being and our economy on a global scale (Naeem et al., 2009). Thus mechanistic understanding and models predicting future ecosystem responses to climate changes are an important basis for management decisions. We aim to understand how an understudied aspect of biodiversity, the biodiversity-related flexibility of ecological systems, allows ecosystems to adjust their properties to altered abiotic and biotic conditions. Depending on the different facets of biodiversity (e.g., genetic, phenotypic, and species diversity) individuals, populations, and communities possess an inherent flexibility, which influences their dynamics and, consequently, those of the entire food web (Figure 8.1). For example, enhanced grazing may lead to a higher proportion of less edible plants. This dampens the reduction of plant biomass, which likely will have a feedback on the biomass and community composition of the herbivores, e.g., the share of herbivorous species able to exploit less edible plants may increase. As a result, the advantage of being less edible is reduced and the edible plants may recover with positive consequences for their consumers. This promotes the coexistence of different plant types and hence biodiversity. Given such feedback loops, the responses of large, non-linear, and intricately interconnected networks, such as food webs, to altered conditions are very difficult to understand and to predict, but of outstanding importance for fundamental and applied ecology. Thus we must broaden our very limited quantitative knowledge and predictive power on how biodiversity affects ecological dynamics and responses to environmental changes.},

abstract = {Climate change is affecting every ecosystem on Earth. Though climate change is global in scope, literature reviews on the biotic impacts of climate change have focused on temperate and polar regions. Tropical species have distinct life histories and physiologies, and ecological communities are assembled differently across latitude. Thus, tropical species and communities may exhibit different responses to climate change compared with those in temperate and polar regions. What are the fingerprints of climate change in the tropics? This review summarizes the current state of knowledge on impacts of climate change in tropical regions and discusses research priorities to better understand the ways in which species and ecological communities are responding to climate change in the most biodiverse places on Earth.Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics, Volume 50 is November 4, 2019.

abstract = {1.Many taxa can be found in food webs that differ in trophic complexity, but it is unclear how trophic complexity affects the performance of particular taxa. In pond food webs, larvae of the salamander Ambystoma opacum occupy the intermediate predator trophic position in a partial intraguild predation (IGP) food web and can function as keystone predators. Larval A. opacum are also found in simpler food webs lacking either top predators or shared prey. 2.We conducted an experiment where a partial IGP food web was simplified, and we measured the growth and survival of larval A. opacum in each set of food webs. Partial IGP food webs that had either a low abundance or high abundance of total prey were also simplified by independently removing top predators and/or shared prey. 3.Removing top predators always increased A. opacum survival, but removal of shared prey had no effect on A. opacum survival, regardless of total prey abundance. 4.Surprisingly, food web simplification had no effect on the growth of A. opacum when present in food webs with a low abundance of prey but had important effects on A. opacum growth in food webs with a high abundance of prey. Simplifying a partial IGP food web with a high abundance of prey reduced A. opacum growth when either top predators or shared prey were removed from the food web and the loss of top predators and shared prey influenced A. opacum growth in a non-additive fashion. 5.The non-additive response in A. opacum growth appears to be the result of supplemental prey availability augmenting the beneficial effects of top predators. Top predators had a beneficial effect on A. opacum populations by reducing the abundance of A. opacum present and thereby reducing the intensity of intraspecific competition. 6.Our study indicates that the effects of food web simplification on the performance of A. opacum are complex and depend on both how a partial IGP food web is simplified and how abundant prey are in the food web. These findings are important because they demonstrate how trophic complexity can create variation in the performance of intermediate predators that play important roles in temporary pond food webs. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {The rapidly increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases may lead to significant changes in regional and seasonal climate patterns. Such changes can strongly influence the diversity and distribution of species and, therefore, affect ecosystems and biodiversity. To assess these changes we developed a model, called EUROMOVE. The model uses climate data from 1990 to 2050 as compiled from the IMAGE 2 model, and determines climate envelopes for about 1400 plant species by multiple logistic regression analysis. The climate envelopes were applied to the projected climate to obtain predictions about plant diversity and distributions by 2050. For each European grid cell, EUROMOVE calculates which species would still occur in forecasted future climate conditions and which not. The results show major changes in biodiversity by 2050. On average, 32{\%} of the European plant species that were present in a cell in 1990 would disappear from that cell. The area, in which 32{\%} or more of the 1990 species will disappear, takes up 44{\%} of the modelled European area. Individual responses of the plant species to the forecasted climate change were diverse. In reviewing possible future trends, we found that plant species, in general, would find their current climate envelopes further northeast by 2050, shifting ranges that were comparable with those ranges in other studies.},

Yet, niche studies have been limited to describe coexistence within tropic levels despite incorporating information about multi-trophic interactions. Network approaches could address this limitation, but they have ignored the structure of species interactions within trophic levels. Here we call for the integration of niche and network theories to reach new frontiers of knowledge exploring how interactions within and across trophic levels promote species coexistence. This integration is possible due to the strong parallelisms in the historical development, ecological concepts, and associated mathematical tools of both theories. We provide a guideline to integrate this framework with observational and experimental studies.},

abstract = {Edge effects in fragmented natural habitats may be exacerbated by intensive land use in the surrounding landscape. Given that most managed systems have higher primary productivity than adjacent natural systems, theory suggests that bottom-up subsidized consumers are likely to spill over from managed to natural habitats. Furthermore, the magnitude of spillover is likely to differ between generalist and specialist consumers, because of differences in their ability to use the full spectrum of resources. However, it is unknown whether there is indeed asymmetrical spillover of consumers between managed and natural habitats, and whether this is related to resource abundance or the trophic specialization of the consumer. We used flight intercept traps to measure spillover of generalist predators (Vespula wasps, Vespidae) and more specialist predators (106 species of parasitoids, Ichneumonidae and Braconidae) across habitat edges between native New Zealand forest and exotic plantation forest over a summer season. We found net spillover of both generalist and specialist predators from plantation to native forest, and that this was greater for generalists. To test whether natural enemy spillover from managed habitats was related to prey (caterpillar) abundance (i.e., whether it was bottom-up productivity driven, due to increased primary productivity), we conducted a large-scale herbivore reduction experiment at half of our plantation sites, by helicopter spraying caterpillar-specific insecticide over 2.5 ha per site. We monitored bidirectional natural enemy spillover and found that herbivore reduction reduced generalist but not specialist predator spillover. Trophic generalists may benefit disproportionately from high resource productivity in a habitat, and their cross-habitat spillover effects on natural food webs may be an important source of consumer pressure in mosaic landscapes.},

abstract = {1. The structure and dynamics of prey populations are shaped by the foraging behaviours of their predators. Yet, there is still little documentation on how distinct predator foraging types control biodiversity, food-web architecture and ecosystem functioning. 2. We experimentally compared the effects of model fish species of two major foraging types of lake planktivores: a size-selective visual feeder (bluegill), and a filter feeder (gizzard shad). The visual feeder forages on individually captured consumer prey, whereas the filter feeder forages on various prey simultaneously, not only consumers but also primary producers. We ran a 1-month mesocosm experiment cross-classifying a biomass gradient of each predator type. We analysed the effect of each fish on food-web architecture by computing major topological descriptors over time (connectance, link density, omnivory index, etc.). These descriptors were computed from 80 predator-prey binary matrices, using taxa mostly identified at the species level. 3. We found that the visual feeder induced more trophic cul-de-sac (inedible) primary-producer species, lower link density and connectance, and lower levels of food-web omnivory and generalism than the filter feeder. Yet, predator biomass did not affect food-web topology. 4. Our results highlight that top-predator foraging behaviour is a key functional trait that can drive food-web topology and ultimately ecosystem functioning. {\textcopyright} 2009 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {Climate change is expected to cause shifts in species distributions worldwide, threatening their viability due to range reductions and altering their representation in protected areas. Biodiversity hotspots might be particularly vulnerable to climate change because they hold large numbers of species with small ranges which could contract even further as species track their optimal habitat. In this study, we assessed the extent to which climate change could cause distribution shifts in threatened and range-restricted birds in Colombia, a megadiverse region that includes the Tropical Andes and Tumbes-Choco-Magdalena hotspots. To evaluate how climate change might influence species in this region, we developed species distribution models using MAXENT. Species are projected to lose on average between 33 and 43 {\%} of their total range under future climate, and up to 18 species may lose their climatically suitable range completely. Species whose suitable climate is projected to disappear occur in mountainous regions, particularly isolated ranges such as the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. Depending on the representation target considered, between 46 and 96 {\%} of the species evaluated may be adequately represented in protected areas. In the future, the fraction of species potentially adequately represented is projected to decline to 30-95 {\%}. Additional protected areas may help to retain representativeness of protected areas, but monitoring of species projected to have the largest potential declines in range size will be necessary to assess the need of implementing active management strategies to counteract the effects of climate change. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Recent increases in human disturbance pose significant threats to migratory species using collective movement strategies. Key threats to migrants may differ depending on behavioural traits (e.g. collective navigation), taxonomy and the environmental system (i.e. freshwater, marine or terrestrial) associated with migration. We quantitatively assess how collective navigation, taxonomic membership and environmental system impact species' vulnerability by (i) evaluating population change in migratory and non-migratory bird, mammal and fish species using the Living Planet Database (LPD), (ii) analysing the role of collective navigation and environmental system on migrant extinction risk using International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) classifications and (iii) compiling literature on geographical range change of migratory species. Likelihood of population decrease differed by taxonomic group: migratory birds were more likely to experience annual declines than non-migrants, while mammals displayed the opposite pattern. Within migratory species in IUCN, we observed that collective navigation and environmental system were important predictors of extinction risk for fishes and birds, but not for mammals, which had overall higher extinction risk than other taxa. We found high phylogenetic relatedness among collectively navigating species, which could have obscured its importance in determining extinction risk. Overall, outputs from these analyses can help guide strategic interventions to conserve the most vulnerable migrations. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Collective movement ecology'.},

Pelage coloration of fetuses and neonates were described for P. melalophos and P. femoralis. Based on this study, three species -P. thomasi, P. melalophos, and P. femoralis - are recognized. Using field data that have been gathered since 1981, the distribution of these three species has been mapped. The resultant map reveals that no sympatry is known and that rivers form the interspecific boundaries. However, rivers apparently are not barriers to the dispersal of species in this group. Instead, distributions appear to be limited ecologically, by competitive exclusion. Historically, it appears that the ancestral stock initially dispersed throughout this area, then the P. melalophos stock split from the P. thomasi-P. femoralis stock, the P. thomasi stock split from the P. femoralis stock, and, finally, the P. femoralis stock dispersed to eastern Sumatera. It appears unlikely that the centrifugal speciation hypothesis based on the principle of metachromism applies to deployment of the P. melalophos group.},

Meadows disturbed by clam harvesting were compared with undisturbed meadows in 2 sectors of the lagoon. In both sectors, disturbed meadows showed significantly lower vegetative shoot density and significantly higher reproductive effort. The reproductive effort in the western disturbed meadows was 2-fold higher than in undisturbed meadows, whereas in eastern disturbed meadows it was 4-fold higher. In disturbed meadows, early maturation stages were found until the end of the flowering season and higher seed production was observed. Both the negative effect of clam harvesting on Z. noltii density and the positive effect on its reproductive effort were confirmed by manipulative field experiments. Plots that were experimentally harvested during the fertile season showed significantly lower vegetative shoot density and higher reproductive effort than unharvested plots. Results suggest that Z. noltii responds to clam harvesting disturbance by both increasing its reproductive effort and extending its fertile season.},

abstract = {Understanding how species respond to climate change is critical for forecasting the future dynamics and distribution of pests, diseases and biological diversity. Although ecologists have long acknowledged species' direct physiological and demographic responses to climate, more recent work suggests that these direct responses can be overwhelmed by indirect effects mediated via other interacting community members. Theory suggests that some of the most dramatic impacts of community change will probably arise through the assembly of novel species combinations after asynchronous migrations with climate. Empirical tests of this prediction are rare, as existing work focuses on the effects of changing interactions between competitors that co-occur today. To explore how species' responses to climate warming depend on how their competitors migrate to track climate, we transplanted alpine plant species and intact plant communities along a climate gradient in the Swiss Alps. Here we show that when alpine plants were transplanted to warmer climates to simulate a migration failure, their performance was strongly reduced by novel competitors that could migrate upwards from lower elevation; these effects generally exceeded the impact of warming on competition with current competitors. In contrast, when we grew the focal plants under their current climate to simulate climate tracking, a shift in the competitive environment to novel high-elevation competitors had little to no effect. This asymmetry in the importance of changing competitor identity at the leading versus trailing range edges is best explained by the degree of functional similarity between current and novel competitors. We conclude that accounting for novel competitive interactions may be essential to predict species' responses to climate change accurately.},

abstract = {Management of the food web is important in maintaining ecosystem functions; however, the studies to assess anthropogenic impact on food web structures are very limited. Recently, shoreline development is considered to impact the littoral zone of lakes through loss of littoral habitats. Shoreline engineering would consequently modify the food web structure and coupling between benthic and pelagic habitats. Thus, we investigated whether lakeshore modification would change benthic-pelagic coupling by largemouth bass in 15 ponds, which differed in the proportion of concrete bank modification. We performed isotope mixing models to estimate benthic contribution to the fish species and tested the relationships with environmental factors including proportion of bank modification by general linear models. These results showed that the benthic contribution to largemouth bass was strongly related to the proportion of anthropogenic shoreline modification, while for bluegill sunfish, the benthic contribution was not changed with anthropogenic shoreline modification. Therefore, anthropogenic modification of shoreline strongly modified the food webs in ponds through the littoral habitat modification. The results suggested that we should pay attention to the anthropogenic impact on food web structures to maintain ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We surveyed 1,000 randomly selected papers from 496 journals and compared the facets of movement studied with a suggested framework for movement ecology, consisting of internal state (motivation, physiology), motion and navigation capacities, and external factors (both the physical environment and living organisms), and links among these com- ponents. Most studies simply measured and described the move- ment of organisms without reference to ecological or internal factors, and the most frequently studied part of the framework was the link between external factors and motion capacity. Few studies looked at the effects on movement of navigation capacity, or internal state, and those were mainly from vertebrates. For invertebrates and plants most studies were at the population level, whereas more vertebrate studies were conducted at the individual level. Consideration of only population-level averages promul- gates neglect of between-individual variation in movement, po- tentially hindering the study of factors controlling movement. Terminology was found to be inconsistent among taxa and sub- disciplines. The gaps identified in coverage of movement studies highlight research areas that should be addressed to fully under- stand the ecology of movement.},
annote = {- Out of a lot of studies most of them were focusing at an individual level for vertebrates and at a population level for plants and invertebrates. Studying movement at a population level will hide all the different factors that influence the individual response.

- There are three main problems with movement ecology:
1. We think we understood movement once we give it a name
2. We don't dig deep into movement even if we recognize it's one of the reasons of a certain ecological outcome
3. There are disciplinary boundaries that make it hard to integrate movement ecology and other disciplines

- What we could do is also using model organisms to understand movement

- What we know at the moment comes mainly from big vertebrate movement. These studies focus mainly on empirical explanations for the movement that don't refer to any model and that can't be generalised outside from that particular species/taxon.},

abstract = {Available data on species distributions and endemicity were compiled and examined for 11 groups of South African marine invertebrates (2533 species). For five groups species richness adhered to a well-documented pattern, increasing from west to east, but for the other groups species richness was highest along the south coast. Endemicity was generally highest along the south coast, and lowest along the east coast. The data base was then analysed using several types of complementarity analyses, each producing a minimum set of potential reserve areas, which cumulatively represent all invertebrate species analysed. Approaches based solely on rarity, species richness and endemicity demonstrated individual biases, suggesting a need to combine all three interests. Combining the three techniques produced similar results to the individual analyses, showing conservation priorities to be highest along the east coast. Specifically, the areas of Port Elizabeth and Durban were ranked high in all analyses. Consistently, a total of 16 sites was necessary to represent all species analysed. Comparisons with similar analyses on fish and seaweeds revealed similar findings. Existing invertebrate records were shown to be biased towards centres of high sampling activity, demonstrating a need of future sampling attention in underrepresented areas.},

abstract = {Few data are available on gibbon populations in peat-swamp forest. In order to assess the importance of this habitat for gibbon conservation, a population of Hylobates agilis albibarbis was surveyed in the Sabangau peat-swamp forest, Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. This is an area of about 5,500 km(2) of selectively logged peat-swamp forest, which was formally gazetted as a national park during 2005. The study was conducted during June and July 2004 using auditory sampling methods. Five sample areas were selected and each was surveyed for four consecutive days by three teams of researchers at designated listening posts. Researchers recorded compass bearings of, and estimated distances to, singing groups. Nineteen groups were located. Population density is estimated to be 2.16 (+/-0.46) groups/km(2). Sightings occurring either at the listening posts or that were obtained by tracking in on calling groups yielded a mean group size of 3.4 individuals, hence individual gibbon density is estimated to be 7.4 (+/-1.59) individuals/km(2). The density estimates fall at the mid-range of those calculated for other gibbon populations, thus suggesting that peat-swamp forest is an important habitat for gibbon conservation in Borneo. A tentative extrapolation of results suggests a potential gibbon population size of 19,000 individuals within the mixed-swamp forest habitat sub-type in the Sabangau. This represents one of the largest remaining continuous populations of Bornean agile gibbons. The designation of the Sabangau forest as a national park will hopefully address the problem of illegal logging and hunting in the region. Further studies should note any difference in gibbon density post protection.},

abstract = {Network approaches to ecological questions have been increasingly used, particularly in recent decades. The abstraction of ecological systems – such as communities – through networks of interactions between their components indeed provides a way to summarize this information with single objects. The methodological framework derived from graph theory also provides numerous approaches and measures to analyze these objects and can offer new perspectives on established ecological theories as well as tools to address new challenges. However, prior to using these methods to test ecological hypotheses, it is necessary that we understand, adapt, and use them in ways that both allow us to deliver their full potential and account for their limitations. Here, we attempt to increase the accessibility of network approaches by providing a review of the tools that have been developed so far, with – what we believe to be – their appropriate uses and potential limitations. This is not an exhaustive review of all methods and metrics, but rather, an overview of tools that are robust, informative, and ecologically sound. After providing a brief presentation of species interaction networks and how to build them in order to summarize ecological information of different types, we then classify methods and metrics by the types of ecological questions that they can be used to answer from global to local scales, including methods for hypothesis testing and future perspectives. Specifically, we show how the organization of species interactions in a community yields different network structures (e.g., more or less dense, modular or nested), how different measures can be used to describe and quantify these emerging structures, and how to compare communities based on these differences in structures. Within networks, we illustrate metrics that can be used to describe and compare the functional and dynamic roles of species based on their position in the network and the organization of their interactions as well as associated new methods to test the significance of these results. Lastly, we describe potential fruitful avenues for new methodological developments to address novel ecological questions.},

abstract = {Anthropogenic change in the abundance or identity of dominant top predators may induce reorganizations in whole food webs. Predicting these reorganizations requires identifying the biological rules that govern trophic niches. However, we still lack a detailed understanding of the respective contributions of body size, behaviour (e.g. match between predator hunting mode and prey antipredator strategy), phylogeny and/or ontogeny in determining both the presence and strength of trophic interactions. Here, we address this question by measuring zooplankton numerical response to fish predators in lake enclosures. We compared the fit to zooplankton count data of models grouping zooplankters based either on 1) body sizes, 2) antipredator behaviour, 3) body size combined with antipredator behaviour or on 4) phylogeny combined with ontogeny (i.e. different life stages of copepods). Body size was a better predictor of zooplankton numerical response to fish than antipredator behaviour, but combining body size and behaviour provided even better predictions. Models based on phylogeny combined with ontogeny clearly outperformed those based on other zooplankton grouping rules, except when phylogeny was poorly resolved. Removing ontogenetic information plagued the predictive power of the highly-resolved (genus-level) phylogenetic grouping but not of medium-resolved or poorly-resolved phylogenetic grouping. Our results support the recent use of phylogeny as a superior surrogate for traits controlling trophic niches, and further highlight the added value of combining phylogeny with ontogenetic traits. Further improvements in our mechanistic understanding of how trophic networks are shaped are bound to uncovering the trophic traits captured by phylogeny and ontogeny, but that currently remain hidden to us.},

abstract = {Understanding how biogeochemical cycles relate to the structure of ecological communities is a central research question in ecology. Here we approach this problem by focusing on body size, which is an easily measured species trait that has a pervasive influence on multiple aspects of community structure and ecosystem functioning. We test the predictions of a model derived from metabolic theory using data on ecosystem metabolism and community size structure. These data were collected as part of an aquatic mesocosm experiment that was designed to simulate future environmental warming. Our analyses demonstrate significant linkages between community size structure and ecosystem functioning, and the effects of warming on these links. Specifically, we show that carbon fluxes were significantly influenced by seasonal variation in temperature, and yielded activation energies remarkably similar to those predicted based on the temperature dependencies of individual-level photosynthesis and respiration. We also show that community size structure significantly influenced fluxes of ecosystem respiration and gross primary production, particularly at the annual time-scale. Assessing size structure and the factors that control it, both empirically and theoretically, therefore promises to aid in understanding links between individual organisms and biogeochemical cycles, and in predicting the responses of key ecosystem functions to future environmental change. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Royal Society.},

abstract = {Parametric kernel methods currently dominate the literature regarding the construction of animal home ranges (HRs) and utilization distributions (UDs). These methods frequently fail to capture the kinds of hard boundaries common to many natural systems. Recently a local convex hull (LoCoH) nonparametric kernel method, which generalizes the minimum convex polygon (MCP) method, was shown to be more appropriate than parametric kernel methods for constructing HRs and UDs, because of its ability to identify hard boundaries (e.g., rivers, cliff edges) and convergence to the true distribution as sample size increases. Here we extend the LoCoH in two ways: "fixed sphere-of-influence," or r-LoCoH (kernels constructed from all points within a fixed radius r of each reference point), and an "adaptive sphere-of-influence," or a-LoCoH (kernels constructed from all points within a radius a such that the distances of all points within the radius to the reference point sum to a value less than or equal to a), and compare them to the original "fixed-number-of-points," or k-LoCoH (all kernels constructed from k-1 nearest neighbors of root points). We also compare these nonparametric LoCoH to parametric kernel methods using manufactured data and data collected from GPS collars on African buffalo in the Kruger National Park, South Africa. Our results demonstrate that LoCoH methods are superior to parametric kernel methods in estimating areas used by animals, excluding unused areas (holes) and, generally, in constructing UDs and HRs arising from the movement of animals influenced by hard boundaries and irregular structures (e.g., rocky outcrops). We also demonstrate that a-LoCoH is generally superior to k- and r-LoCoH (with software for all three methods available at http://locoh.cnr.berkeley.edu).},

Comprising a substantial part of living biomass on earth, ants are integral to the functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. More than 12,000 species have been described to date, and it is estimated that perhaps as many still await classification. Their social structure provides a rich ground for exploring how division of labour affects the acquisition of resources, foraging and defensive behaviours, and coevolution with the flora and fauna with which they interact. The study of ants has led to significant advances in our understanding of insect evolution, global diversity patterns, competitive interactions, mutualisms, ecosystem's responses to change, and biological invasions. Ant Ecology explores these and other key ecological issues and new developments in myrmecology across a range of scales. The book begins with a global perspective on species diversity in time and space and explores interactions at the community level before describing the population ecology of these social insects. The final section covers the recent ecological phenomenon of invasive ants: how they move across the globe, invade, affect ecosystems, and are managed by humans. Each chapter links ant ecology to broader ecological principles, provides a succinct summary, and discusses future research directions. The Synthesis and Perspectives highlights contributions of ant ecology to ecology more broadly, and outlines promising areas for future research.},

Identifying the roles of species on ecological network robustness is an effective way to conserve biodiversity. Previous studies have mostly focused on the role of an individual species in the whole food web. They ignored the truth that food webs consist of a large number of motifs (patterns of interconnections occurring in complex networks at numbers that are significantly higher than those in randomized networks). Here, we proposed motif-based centrality measurements to identify keystone species. Both topological and dynamical approaches were employed to assess changes in ecosystem stability. After removing species according to various deletion sequences based on different motif centralities, secondary extinctions were recorded during sequential removals, and then robustness was calculated. We found that species with higher motif-based centrality (those who participated more food-web motifs) were more influential. It indicates that the motif-based centrality is an effective indicator for the identification of keystone species. Our findings emphasized the importance of motifs when detecting the role of a species in maintaining local biodiversity and provided a new aspect of environment management.},

abstract = {There is ample evidence for ecological responses to recent climate change. Most studies to date have concentrated on the effects of climate change on individuals and species, with particular emphasis on the effects on phenology and physiology of organisms as well as changes in the distribution and range shifts of species. However, responses by individual species to climate change are not isolated; they are connected through interactions with others at the same or adjacent trophic levels. Also from this more complex perspective, recent case studies have emphasized evidence on the effects of climate change on biotic interactions and ecosystem services. This review highlights the 'knowns' but also 'unknowns' resulting from recent climate impact studies and reveals limitations of (linear) extrapolations from recent climate-induced responses of species to expected trends and magnitudes of future climate change. Hence, there is need not only to continue to focus on the impacts of climate change on the actors in ecological networks but also and more intensively to focus on the linkages between them, and to acknowledge that biotic interactions and feedback processes lead to highly complex, nonlinear and sometimes abrupt responses. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society.},
annote = {Climate change will cause responses by species in many different ways, for example in range shift and in phenology changes. Phenological changes that are not synchronised between interacting species will have great effects on ecological networks (food webs, mutualistic networks, host-parasitoid networks). Range shift can happen in different ways. Breshears et al. (2008) found three ways applicable to upslope movements (it might be that it's the same also with latitude tough): 
{\textperiodcentered}      March: the range moves upslope 
{\textperiodcentered}      Lean: the range stays the same but the average distribution shifts 
{\textperiodcentered}      Crash: the range stays the same and mortality increases 
  
Asynchronous responses in species will almost surely cause novel communities to arise and change the evenness of communities, which will have a great impact on their features. 
  
Furthermore, if ecosystems pass a certain threshold (e.g. T of the ocean in the coral reef) they collapse.},

Using AdaptR to predict change in the distribution of 17 species of Australian fruit flies (Drosophilidae), we show that accounting for adaptive capacity reduces projected range losses by up to 33{\%} by 2105. We identify where local adaptation is likely to occur and apply sensitivity analyses to identify the critical factors of interest when parameters are uncertain.

The subspecies of mitrata are known to be found along the Batanghari River, to the Geopark Mengkarang Purba area. However, data on the number of species in their habitat in Geopark Mengkarang Purba is not yet available. Thus, research on the demographics of riparian populations in riparian areas and the diversity of tree species as a residential habitat in the region is required.

The level of tree species diversity found in 31 species at the study site is close to high (H '= 2,96), most of which are found as fruit trees useful for the life and development of the Sumatran surili population.},
annote = {PRELIMINARY
Sumatran or Surili Sumatran (Presbytis
melalophos ssp. mitrata Eschsholtz, 1821) is one of the primate species that has an important role for nature. Because the main feed of the genus Presbytis is shoots, fruits and seeds of plants (Sabarno 1998), this primate group can help the forest regeneration process. If the population of the genus Presbytis decreases, it will affect the smoothness of the natural succession process of the forest.
Circles and other Presbytis groups scattered on
Southeast Asian forests, especially in Indonesia. In Indonesia this genus is an endemic primate of several islands, such as Kalimantan and Sumatra (Ruslin and Zain 2012). Simpai P. melalophos mitrata can be found in southeast Sumatra, from North Lampung to the upper Musi River, west of Palembang, and north to the Batang Hari River (Groves 2001). Based on the distribution area, the habitat that is favored by hoops can be stated as areas close to water sources or river flows. Bugiono (2001) found about 38 types of feed loops in the form of leaves and fruit originating from a variety of plant families, such as Anarcadiaceae, Moraceae, Myrtaceae, Fabaceae and others around river banks. The development of hoop life depends on the condition of its habitat, especially feed available in nature (Bugiono 2001). Thus, habitat changes in hoop life can affect their existence. This is because habitat changes have an impact on reduced tree species that cover the life of the hoop population. Riparian area of ​​Ancient Ancient Geopark
Merangin is thought to be one of the hoop habitats in Sumatra based on encounters with hoops in preliminary research. In addition to various fossils of fossilized plants and shells printed in stone, Geopark Mengkarang Purba also has the potential for flora and fauna species that are still not widely studied and studied scientifically. However, data on population and components of hoop habitat in the Geopark Mengkarang Purba area, especially along riparian areas, are not yet available. Alikodra (2010) confirms that in
achieving the goal of managing wildlife protection requires an organized process, so that every planning and implementation activity can be carried out properly. But in reality on the ground, protection and proper management of habitats for hoops, especially in the riparian area of ​​Purba Merangin Geopark Mengkarang Purba is still unknown and has not been implemented. This is because there is no research on hoop populations in the region. Thus a study is needed on the population of hoops and forest vegetation in Mengkarang Purba Geopark so that the hoop habitat in the area can support its survival so that the preservation of the habitat of these wildlife populations can be realized. This study aims to (1) measure
demographics of hoop populations in riparian areas, including population size, sex ratio, age structure, and population density; (2) identify the diversity of tree species as hoop habitat in the riparian area of ​​Purba Merangin Geopark.

RESEARCH METHODS Research data were collected for ± 3 months at
the Geopark Merangin area, precisely in the riparian area of ​​Mengkarang Purba river, Bangko Barat District in Bedeng Rejo Village and Rengas Ulu Village. Geographically this location is located at 02o10'43.9 "LS, 102o10'47,5" BT with a bumpy topography (Figure 1). All aspects of population demographics are observed with
strip transect technique. In this method, observers walk along a 1,000 x 100 meter track for 10 replications per day (Santosa and Sitorus 2008) (Figure 2). One observation day is divided into 2 times, namely morning at 06.00-08.00 WIB and afternoon at 15.00 - 17.00 WIB. Division
This time is based on the assumption that the hoop is more active in the morning and evening (Bugiono 2001). The number of tracks observed is 3 lanes with
each area is 10 hectares. The number of lines is determined based on the intensity of sampling (IS) of 0.48{\%} of the total area of ​​the research location, which is 15.95 km2. The percentage of IS is determined based on consideration of the maximum home range of the hoop, which is ± 30 ha. The path position is determined purposively or deliberately based on the following considerations: (a) Topographic conditions of the location under study
Demographics of hoop populations
(b) Locations with high chance of meeting loops based on preliminary surveys, and
(c) There is a river around the alleged location. In order to avoid double counting
(double counting),
distance between observation lines
set at least ± 300 m with the lane placement from the edge of the river flow ± 100 m (Figure 3). Age structure identified according to criteria
the age of hoops, namely children, young, and adults. The characteristics of each stage of the development of the hoop are as follows (Arief and Wicaksono 2014): 1. Class age of children, namely ages ranging from 0-1 years, characterized by a small body size, orange, and still dependent on the parent, colored hair white and some dark colored that stretches from head to tail and is more often in the mother sling.
2. Young age classes, namely ages ranging from 1-6 years, are characterized by a body size that is smaller or almost the same as an adult individual, but the color of the hair is bright orange, the darker part of the hair fades,
the inside of the thigh is shaped like a line until the ankles remain white and begin to form a crest.
3. The adult age class, which ranges from 6-20 years old, is characterized by a larger body size and brownish orange hair color, brownish red hair on the abdomen and the inside of the thigh is white and the crest is perfectly formed. Sex of the hoop (male and female)
identified based on gender estimation parameters, such as body length, body mass, body color, and the presence of vocalizations. Gender is calculated only in the adult age class, because sex ratios considered in managing wildlife according to Santosa (1993) are potential reproductive males and females.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
1. Demographics of Stacked Populations in Purba Merangin Geopark
a. The size and density of the Simpai population are found in all locations
observations totaling 29 individuals. The population value is higher than that of Pakpahan (2015) in Repong Damar, Pekon Pahmungan, West Coast with a population size of 16 individuals. But when compared to the results of the research by Bismark et. al. (2002) in Situ Nature Reserve The size of the population obtained during the study included small causes
research by Bismark et al. (2002) found as many as 39 birds at the observation location. The two research locations have similarities with the Geoprak Mengkarang Purba area, which is located on the border of plantation land. Population size and hoop population density
found on each path shows different numbers. The second observation pathway has the highest encounter with the hoop during observation. Meanwhile, the least found pathway is the third line (Figures 4 and 5). But in general, in one observation, the hoop can

found
7 12 individuals.
Based on the density value of each line (Figure
5), the estimated size of the hoop population in the Purba Merangin Geopark Mengkarang area is approximately ± 983.58 individuals from the total area of ​​the study, which is 15.95 km2. This value is obtained based on the assumption that the existence of feed is spread evenly in almost all observation areas. This value is lower than Nurdin's (2010) study in Tesso Nilo National Park, which found other members of the Cercopithecidae family with an estimated population of 10,800 individuals from the total area of ​​the study, 13,500 ha.
One of the factors that affect the level of encounter hoops is the presence of feed trees, the presence of other animals, and the condition of vegetation (Violita and Cindy 2015) and water sources. In line with this, Alikodra (2010) states that the limiting factor for wildlife is water and food. Potential types of feed for animals are influenced by physical conditions and biotic conditions of a habitat. If a habitat is disturbed, it will have a big influence on the existence of an animal population, as well as the existence of a hoop population in its habitat. Chimpanzees are folivorous animals which consume leaves as their main feed (Sabarno 1998). Feed is a functional resource for wildlife life for survival. b. Size and population density The results showed that the ratio of hoops
male sex less than female population (Figure 6). However the number of male to female sex ratios of 1: 2 shows symptoms of a common sex ratio. In its habitat in nature, male and several hoops
Demographics of hoop populations
other types of primates include species that have more than one partner (polygamy). This condition is not much different from the results
research in several locations. Bismark et al. (2002) found the sex ratio of hoops in the Situ Patengan Nature Reserve area to be quite good and evenly distributed with a ratio of 1: 1.86. Whereas in the study of Violita and Cindy (2015) male and female sex ratios were found to be 1: 2 in Cugung Village Forest, South Lampung and spread evenly across the region. c. Size and population density The age structure of the hoop population found in
Overall, the Mengkarang Purba Geopark area shows a fairly good population condition (Figure 7). Although the number of children is not in accordance with ideal conditions (children should be more than adults), but the development of the population can be charged to the number of adolescents. Figure 7 shows that the youth population
quite a lot. Especially if young people (children and adolescents) are combined, it will be more numerous compared to old age (adults). Thus the age structure in the area of ​​Mengkarang Purba Geopark can be said to be quite developed. In line with this, Tarumingkeng (1994) states that the population develops when the young population continues to increase and exceeds the number of old age. 2. Demographics of Stacked Populations in Purba Merangin Geopark
The trees used inside the hoop
this study found 31 species with a total number of individuals of 365. The 31 types were spread into 17 families. Generally, the tree species found during the study were fruit trees used by hoops to fulfill their eating activities. The types of fruit trees include durian
(Durio zibethinus), matoa (Pometia pinnata Forst. {\&} Forst), petai (Parkia speciosa), rambe (Baccaurea javanica (Blume)), forest rambutan (Nephelium cuspidatum Blume.), Tampuy (Baccaurea macrocarpa (Miq)), kelengkeng ( Dimocarpus longan), macang (Mangifera foetida Lour.), Guava klawa (Bellucia pentamera Naudin) and acid depah (Mangifera applanata Kosterm.). Some other types include trees that are intended for protective needs and fulfill moving activities because they have lush canopy. However, the most tree species in the Merangin Geopark area are rubber (Hevea braziliensis) (Figure 8). Based on observations and information from surrounding communities, the loops found are among several trees that have abundant food sources. Chimps are often found eating fruits and shoots from rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis), petai (Parkia speciosa), lansat forest
(Lansium sp.) And figs (Ficus racemosa). From the results of observations, hoops are often found on tree trunks, one of which is rubber trees (Hevea brasiliensis) (Figure 9). This is because rubber trees are the dominant species found in the area, both those that grow naturally and those planted by communities around the Purba Merangin Geopark Mengkarang area. Research conducted by Mukhtar (1990)
in Bugiono (2001) also supports this, the hoop likes leaves of fig tree kelumpong (Ficus variegate) and rubber (Hevea brasiliensis). At the time of observation, trees with the Moraceae family are the plants that are most often found as well as being the vegetation that is used by hoops in their activities. In line with this, Siahaan (2002) research in the Gunung Salak area
also found that the Moraceae family is the most widely used by hoops. The results of the analysis of the level of diversity
the type shows that in the tree stage, the species diversity is classified as moderate. Nearly 3 diversity values (H '= 2.96) indicate that the level of tree species diversity in the Geopark Merangin area as a hoop habitat is almost high.

CONCLUDE The actual number of hoops found in
The Mengkarang Purba Geopark area is 29 individuals with a sex ratio of 1: 2 and an age structure that is considered progressive for the growth of the hoop population in the Ancient Pengarang Geopark. The diversity of tree species found as many as 31 species in the study location is almost close to high (H '= 2.96), among them the most found are fruit tree species that are useful for the life and development of the hoop population.},

Recent work shows that primary productivity often, but not always, saturates with species richness within single trophic levels. However, any interpretation of such patterns must consider that variation in biodiversity is necessarily associated with changes in species composition (identity), and that changes in biodiversity often occur across multiple trophic levels. Here we present results from a mesocosm experiment in which we independently manipulated species richness and species composition across multiple trophic levels in pond food webs. In contrast to previous studies that focused on single trophic levels, we found that productivity is either idiosyncratic or increases with respect to species richness, and that richness influences trophic structure. However, the composition of species within richness levels can have equally or more marked effects on ecosystems than average effects of richness per se. Indirect evidence suggests that richness and associated changes in species composition affect ecosystem attributes through indirect effects and trophic interactions among species, features that are highly characteristic of natural, complex ecosystems.},

This buttress drumming occurs in discrete bouts of rapidly delivered beats that usually accompany "pant hoots," the species-specific long-distance vocalization. Individual differences in male chimpanzee (P.t. verus) drumming were investigated during a 6-month field study in the Tai National Park, Ivory Coast. Analysis of drumming bouts recorded from six adult males revealed significant differences between individuals in three acoustic features: (1) mean duration of inter-beat interval; (2) mean number of beats per bout; and (3) mean bout duration. Preliminary analysis indicated that individuals differ in their tendency to deliver drum beats in temporally close pairs separated by longer interbeat intervals. Qualitative examination also suggested that individuals may differ in the temporal integration of drumming into the pant hoot vocalization. These results suggest that there may be acoustic cues available for chimpanzees to recognize unseen males by their drumming performances alone. Drumming by Tai chimpanzees was also compared to drumming by chimpanzees (P.t. schweinfurthii) from the Kanyawara study group in Kibale National Park. Uganda. The Kanyawara chimpanzees appeared to drum more often without vocalizing than did the Tai chimpanzees. When they did drum and vocalize together, the Kanyawara chimpanzees appeared to integrate their drumming later into the associated pant hoots than did the Tdi:chimpanzees. These results suggest the possibility that interpopulation variation exists in chimpanzee buttress drumming.},

abstract = {Ria Formosa lagoon in southern Portugal has an important population of seagrasses that includes Zostera noltii in the intertidal area. The area is classified as a Natural Park and supports a major economic activity - clam farming. This activity has a direct influence on Z. noltii populations by removal of seagrass beds and altering habitat. Geographic Information Systems and spatial analysis were used to produce the first distribution map of Z. noltii in the Ria Formosa and to analyse interactions between clam farming and the level of seagrass protection according to the Natural Park of Ria Formosa. Stakeholder analyses, using interviews, questionnaires and participant observation, were conducted to gain a better understanding of clam farming's influence on seagrass populations. Seagrass covers 45{\%} of the intertidal area while clam farming covers 14{\%}. An additional 75{\%} of the total area of Z. noltii can be potentially converted into clam cultures. The current management of clam farming is largely ineffective, representing a significant obstacle to seagrass conservation. {\textcopyright}2011 Elsevier GmbH.},
annote = {(Guimar{\~{a}}es, Cunha, Nzinga, {\&} Marques, 2011).

Seagrass beds are important because they are one of the most important causes of sediment stabilisation (Duarte {\&} Chiscano, 1999). Ria Formosa seagrass beds are ones of the most important of the whole Portugal (Cunha et al., 2009). However, Ria Formosa is also the main producer of clams in Portugal, producing 90{\%} of the total Portuguese consumption (can't find the paper). To do so, clams are farmed in leaseholds in intertidal zones that are leased by the government (Guimar{\~{a}}es, Cunha, Nzinga, {\&} Maruqes, 2011). The clams' farms are created by removing seagrass beds and replacing them with beach sand or coarse terrestrial sediment (as cited in Guimar{\~{a}}es et al, 2011). Clam harvesting is practiced in intertidal zones as well, except where there are clam farms (Caba{\c{c}}ao, Alexandre, {\&} Santos, 2005). Here it can be for hobby or for getting an extra income (Guimar{\~{a}}es et al., 2011). Clam harvesting ruins the seagrass beds by destroyingrhizomes and shoots and creating fragmentation (Caba{\c{c}}o et al., 2005; Caba{\c{c}}o et al., 2008). Clam farms remove Z. noltii but it has been found that an higher cover in segrass facilitates the settlment (Alexandre et al., 2005). Z. noltii covers the 45{\%} of the intertidal zone of Ria Formosa (1304 ha of 2886 ha) (Guimar{\~{a}}es, Cunha, Nzinga, {\&} Maruqes, 2011). 
Clam farms are more likely to be in bigger areas, which contain at the same time the biggest Z. noltii patches (Guimar{\~{a}}es, Cunha, Nzinga, {\&} Maruqes, 2011). Seagrasses removal could lead to decreased productivity, biodiversity loss, increased habitat fragmentation, sediment resuspension, erosion and alteration of physical processes (e.g. water currents) that may cause a shift to an unvegetated community (Alexandre et al., 2005; Almeida et al. 2008). 
At the moment, 25{\%} of the seagrass bed is protected, however clam harvesting is allowed (Guimar{\~{a}}es, Cunha, Nzinga, {\&} Maruqes, 2011). Guimar{\~{a}}es et al. (2011) suggest that some new policies need to be implemented. Some strategies to protect the meadows include: 
- Crop rotation 
- Restricting the clam harvesting and clam farming to half of the intertidal area 

Check out the zoning scheme. There is a management plan of the Ria Formosa natural park, but seagrasses are not protected.},

We censused both species in the 3,568-km 2 Bukit Barisan Selatan National Park, at the southern limit of their ranges, over a 7-mo period in 2001. First, we monitored daily calling rates from known populations to develop probabilities of calling during a specified number of days and used the probability of calling at ≥1 time during 3 days to convert calling rates to abundance. Next, we used 3-day calibrated call count censuses (n = 31) stratified by distance from forest edge and across a range of elevations to estimate species-specific group densities. We used group size from the known populations as well as data collected ad libitum during the census to convert group density to individual density. Agile gibbon group density averaged 0.67 km −2 (SE = 0.082) and group size averaged 2.6 (SE = 0.73) for a population estimate of 4,479 (SE = 1,331) individuals. Siamang group density averaged 2.23 km −2 (SE = 0.245), and group size averaged 3.9 (SE = 1.09) for a population estimate of 22,390 (SE = 8,138). Agile gibbon and siamang densities are negatively correlated, with agile gibbons more abundant in mid-elevation forests and siamangs most abundant in lowland and submontane forests.

abstract = {Experiments with realistic scenarios of species loss from multitrophic ecosystems may improve insight into how biodiversity affects ecosystem functioning. Using 1000 L mesocoms, we examined effects of nonrandom species loss on community structure and ecosystem functioning of experimental food webs based on multitrophic tropical floodplain lagoon ecosystems. Realistic biodiversity scenarios were developed based on long-term field surveys, and experimental assemblages replicated sequential loss of rare species which occurred across all trophic levels of these complex food webs. Response variables represented multiple components of ecosystem functioning, including nutrient cycling, primary and secondary production, organic matter accumulation and whole ecosystem metabolism. Species richness significantly affected ecosystem function, even after statistically controlling for potentially confounding factors such as total biomass and direct trophic interactions. Overall, loss of rare species was generally associated with lower nutrient concentrations, phytoplankton and zooplankton densities, and whole ecosystem metabolism when compared with more diverse assemblages. This pattern was also observed for overall ecosystem multifunctionality, a combined metric representing the ability of an ecosystem to simultaneously maintain multiple functions. One key exception was attributed to time-dependent effects of intraguild predation, which initially increased values for most ecosystem response variables, but resulted in decreases over time likely due to reduced nutrient remineralization by surviving predators. At the same time, loss of species did not result in strong trophic cascades, possibly a result of compensation and complexity of these multitrophic ecosystems along with a dominance of bottom-up effects. Our results indicate that although rare species may comprise minor components of communities, their loss can have profound ecosystem consequences across multiple trophic levels due to a combination of direct and indirect effects in diverse multitrophic ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2014 Pendleton et al.},

abstract = {Stable isotope analysis has emerged as one of the primary means for examining the structure and dynamics of food webs, and numerous analytical approaches are now commonly used in the field. Techniques range from simple, qualitative inferences based on the isotopic niche, to Bayesian mixing models that can be used to characterize food-web structure at multiple hierarchical levels. We provide a comprehensive review of these techniques, and thus a single reference source to help identify the most useful approaches to apply to a given data set. We structure the review around four general questions: (1) what is the trophic position of an organism in a food web?; (2) which resource pools support consumers?; (3) what additional information does relative position of consumers in isotopic space reveal about food-web structure?; and (4) what is the degree of trophic variability at the intrapopulation level? For each general question, we detail different approaches that have been applied, discussing the strengths and weaknesses of each. We conclude with a set of suggestions that transcend individual analytical approaches, and provide guidance for future applications in the field. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors.

abstract = {Today's scientists are facing the enormous challenge of predicting how climate change will affect species distributions and species assemblages. To do so, ecologists are widely using phenomenological models of species distributions that mainly rely on the concept of species niche and generally ignore species' demography, species' adaptive potential, and biotic interactions. This review examines the potential role of the emerging synthetic discipline of evolutionary community ecology in improving our understanding of how climate change will alter future distribution of biodiversity. We review theoretical and empirical advances about the role of niche evolution, interspecific interactions, and their interplay in altering species geographic ranges and community assembly. We discuss potential ways to integrate complex feedbacks between ecology and evolution in ecological forecasting. We also point at a number of caveats in our understanding of the eco-evolutionary consequences of climate change and highlight several challenges for future research.

abstract = {Ideally, an indicator for biodiversity is a linear correlate to the entity or aspect of biodiversity under evaluation. Different motivations for assessing entities or aspects of biodiversity lead to different value systems; their indicators may not correlate at all. For biodiversity evaluation in agricultural landscapes, three indices are proposed, each consisting of a basket of concordant indicators. They represent the three value systems "conservation" (protection and enhancement of rare and threatened species), "ecology" (ecological resilience, ecosystem functioning, based on species diversity), and "biological control" (diversity of antagonists of potential pest organisms). The quality and reliability of commonly used indicators could and should be tested with a three-step approach. First, the motivations and value systems and their corresponding biodiversity aspects or entities have to be defined. In a time consuming second step, a number of habitats have to be sampled as thoroughly as possible with regard to one or several of the three value systems or motivations. The third step is to test the linear correlations of a choice of easily measurable indicators with the entities quantified in the second step. Some examples of good and bad correlations are discussed. {\textcopyright}2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Pseudoreplication is defined. as the use of inferential statistics to test for treatment effects with data from experiments where either treatments are not replicated (though samples may be) or replicates are not statistically independent. In ANOVA terminology, it is the testing for treatment effects with an error term inappropriate to the hypothesis being considered. Scrutiny of 176 experi-mental studies published between 1960 and the present revealed that pseudoreplication occurred in 27{\%} of them, or 48{\%} of all such studies that applied inferential statistics. The incidence of pseudo-replication is especially high in studies of marine benthos and small mammals. The critical features of controlled experimentation are reviewed. Nondemonic intrusion is defined as the impingement of chance events on an experiment in progress. As a safeguard against both it and preexisting gradients, interspersion of treatments is argued to be an obligatory feature of good design. Especially in small experiments, adequate interspersion can sometimes be assured only by dispensing with strict random-ization procedures. Comprehension of this conflict between interspersion and randomization is aided by distinguishing pre-layout (or conventional) and layout-specifit alpha (probability of type I error). Suggestions are offered to statisticians and editors of ecological j oumals as to how ecologists' under-standing of experimental design and statistics might be improved.},

abstract = {The rate of non-native species introductions continues to increase, with directionality from continents to islands. It is no longer single species but entire networks of coevolved and newly interacting continental species that are establishing on islands. The consequences of multispecies introductions on the population dynamics and interactions of native and introduced species will depend on the form of trophic limitation on island ecosystems. Freed from biotic constraints in their native range, species introduced to islands no longer experience top-down limitation, instead becoming limited by and disrupting bottom-up processes that dominate on resource-limited islands. This framing of the ecological and evolutionary relationships among introduced species with one another and their ecosystem has important consequences for conservation. Whereas on continents the focus of conservation is on restoring native apex species and top-down limitation, on islands the focus must instead be on removing introduced animal and plant species to restore bottom-up limitation.Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics Volume 50 is November 4, 2019.

@misc{Pickett1989a,
abstract = {This chapter analyzes the benefits and shortcomings of inferring a temporal trend from a study of different aged sites. This technique, called space-for-time substi- tution, assumes that spatial and temporal variation are equivalent. Although this assumption has been challenged, studies continue to rely on space-for-time sub- stitution due to necessity or convenience. To evaluate the utility and soundness of space-for-time substitution, I review a variety of studies. Studies of vegetation succession illustrate the generalizing power of space-for-time substitution, but point out the power of direct long-term studies for exposing mechanisms. Space-for-time substitution was initially justi- fied by a deterministic theory of succession, but long-term studies have helped replace that theory. Other systems show a different balance between long-term studies and space- for-time substitution. The utility of space-for-time substitution to generate hypotheses about pattern and mechanism is shown in marine upwelling systems. In a chronosequence of strip-mined sites, space-for-time substitution erroneously suggested a succession; historical factors explained much of the temporal pat- tern. Certain forecasts of acidification and recovery of surface waters are subject to the limitations of space-for-time substitution, as is the quantification of other regimes of stress and disturbance. Much of the problem in evaluating space-for-time substitution lies in using time as a surrogate for the past environment and prior system status. Improved determination of the history of sites constituting a chronosequence can help assess the validity of space-for-time substitution. However, certain transient effects can only be determined via long-term studies. Determination of history can also improve understanding of systems not usually considered to have a significant time dimension. For example, debris dams and organic storage in streams introduce a past to certain aquatic systems. The impact of temporal differences in fish recruitment can cascade through trophic webs in lakes and affect productivity over the long term. In summary, space-for-time substitution has been successful where general or qualitative trends are sought, or when hypotheses are to be generated. It has failed where unrecognized effects in the past of a system were oflarge magnitude. Space-for-time substitution has appeared to be irrelevant where the past has had unsuspected effects. Analysis of the influence of past environments or prior system status is needed to justify space-for-time substitution, link short- and long-term studies, and frame and interpret direct long-term studies. The two techniques are not strict alternatives.},

abstract = {Species respond to climate change in two dominant ways: range shifts in latitude or elevation and phenological shifts of life-history events. Range shifts are widely viewed as the principal mechanism for thermal niche tracking, and phenological shifts in birds and other consumers are widely understood as the principal mechanism for tracking temporal peaks in biotic resources. However, phenological and range shifts each present simultaneous opportunities for temperature and resource tracking, although the possible role for phenological shifts in thermal niche tracking has been widely overlooked. Using a canonical dataset of Californian bird surveys and a detectability-based approach for quantifying phenological signal, we show that Californian bird communities advanced their breeding phenology by 5–12 d over the last century. This phenological shift might track shifting resource peaks, but it also reduces average temperatures during nesting by over 1°C, approximately the same magnitude that average temperatures have warmed over the same period. We further show that early-summer temperature anomalies are correlated with nest success in a continental-scale database of bird nests, suggesting avian thermal niches might be broadly limited by temperatures during nesting. These findings outline an adaptation surface where geographic range and breeding phenology respond jointly to constraints imposed by temperature and resource phenology. By stabilizing temperatures during nesting, phenological shifts might mitigate the need for range shifts. Global change ecology will benefit from further exploring phenological adjustment as a potential mechanism for thermal niche tracking and vice versa.},

abstract = {Top predator losses affect a wide array of ecological processes, and there is growing evidence that top predators are disproportionately vulnerable to environmental changes. Despite increasing recognition of the fundamental role that top predators play in structuring communities and ecosystems, it remains challenging to predict the consequences of predator extinctions in highly variable environments. Both biotic and abiotic drivers determine community structure, and manipulative experiments are necessary to disentangle the effects of predator loss from other co-occurring environmental changes. To explore the consistency of top predator effects in ecological communities that experience high local environmental variability, we experimentally removed top predators from arid-land stream pool mesocosms in southeastern Arizona, USA, and measured natural background environmental conditions. We inoculated mesocosms with aquatic invertebrates from local streams, removed the top predator Abedus herberti (Hemiptera: Belostomatidae) from half of the mesocosms as a treatment, and measured community divergence at the end of the summer dry season. We repeated the experiment in two consecutive years, which represented two very different biotic and abiotic environments. We found that some of the effects of top predator removal were consistent despite significant differences in environmental conditions, community composition, and colonist sources between years. As in other studies, top predator removal did not affect overall species richness or abundance in either year, and we observed inconsistent effects on community and trophic structure. However, top predator removal consistently affected large-bodied species (those in the top 1{\%} of the community body size distribution) in both years, increasing the abundance of mesopredators and decreasing the abundance of detritivores, even though the identity of these species varied between years. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of large taxa to top predator extirpations and suggest that the consistency of observed ecological patterns may be as important as their magnitude. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

To assess these threats, we must quantify the relative impact of climate change on species at different trophic levels. Here, we apply a Climate Sensitivity Profile approach to 10,003 terrestrial and aquatic phenological data sets, spatially matched to temperature and precipitation data, to quantify variation in climate sensitivity. The direction, magnitude and timing of climate sensitivity varied markedly among organisms within taxonomic and trophic groups. Despite this variability, we detected systematic variation in the direction and magnitude of phenological climate sensitivity. Secondary consumers showed consistently lower climate sensitivity than other groups. We used mid-century climate change projections to estimate that the timing of phenological events could change more for primary consumers than for species in other trophic levels (6.2 versus 2.5-2.9 days earlier on average), with substantial taxonomic variation (1.1-14.8 days earlier on average).},

abstract = {Experiments in ecology occur in the laboratory, mesocosm or field. The choice of venue can influence the outcome and may be associated with trade-offs involving realism and precision. We evaluated these trade-offs in an experiment measuring effects of venue on larval traits of Rana temporaria tadpoles. The design included laboratory, mesocosm and field venues, crossed with two treatments (presence and absence of caged Anax imperator dragonfly larvae). Realism of venues was evaluated by comparing experimental with wild tadpoles. Venue influenced nearly every trait we measured, but some were more sensitive to venue than others. Larval and metamorphic performance, external morphology and predator-induced plasticity in many traits varied among venues, while behaviour was less dependent on venue. Tadpoles in mesocosms were most similar to those in field enclosures and the wild, although the phenotypic response to predation risk was greatest in the mesocosm venue. The laboratory environment triggered highly distinctive morphology. Precision was not higher in the laboratory than in other venues. This study suggests that both constraints and research questions must be considered when choosing an appropriate experimental venue. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

@article{Thompson2017,
abstract = {Introduction Disturbance is a pervasive force in ecology. Understanding how disturbance influences natural systems is of growing importance as human impacts become increasingly widespread and drive changes in the magnitude and frequency of disturbance events (e.g., Archibald et al., 2012; Bellard et al., 2012). Critical to managing the effects of disturbance is gaining an understanding of what characteristics of natural communities allow them to persist in the face of disturbance. This endeavor has a long history. Early ecologists concluded that diversity begat stability based on observations of naturally fluctuating systems (e.g., Lindeman, 1942, see Rooney and McCann, 2012). These views were challenged by modeling work in the 1970s (e.g., May, 1972) which found that in highly simplified ecological models, diversity resulted in dynamic instability. Models in later years, which incorporated realistic distributions of link strengths and non-equilibrium dynamics, have yielded the hypothesis that diverse systems are stabilized by a complex net of weak interactions (e.g., Yodzis, 1981; McCann, 2000). Key to the concept of “stability” in ecological systems is the idea of dynamic responses that allow systems to “rebound” to their previous state after disturbance. Holling (1973) called this “ecological resilience.” Fundamental to the idea of resilience is that there are multiple stable states in which an ecosystem can exist, and which have characteristics that maintain those states (Walker et al., 2004). In food-web ecology, this is considered as the tendency of a food web to return to its original topology after a disturbance event (McCann, 2000). The mechanisms that underlie resilience in food webs can be divided into three groups (Figure 7.1). The first is that the individual nodes (populations of species) within the food web have resilient traits, such that when the populations are subject to disturbance, they are able to persist and recover. We term this “nodal resilience” (Figure 7.1a). Nodal resilience of a taxon is not affected by the impacts of disturbance on its resources or consumers, but rather is a direct consequence of the taxon's traits. Resilient traits of taxa can be extremely diverse but include the ability to seek refugia, resting stages that protect against disturbance, and life-history characteristics favoring fast reproduction (Townsend et al., 1997; Bolnick et al., 2011; De Lange et al., 2013).},

Here, we use current elevational range data for six taxonomic groups spanning 90° in latitude to examine the potential impacts of climate-driven range shifts on community change, or 'disassembly', across latitude. Elevational ranges are smaller at low latitudes for most groups and, as a consequence, tropical communities appear to be more sensitive to temperature increases compared with temperate communities. Under site-specific temperature projections, we generally found greater community disassembly in tropical compared with temperate communities, although this varied by dispersal assumptions. Mountain height can impact the amount of community disassembly, with greater change occurring on smaller mountains. Finally, projected community disassembly was higher for ectotherms than endotherms, although the variation among ectotherms was greater than the variation separating endotherms and ectotherms. {\textcopyright} 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.},

abstract = {The structure of free-living arthropod communities on the foliage of Acacia falcata was assessed along an extensive latitudinal gradient in eastern Australia. We hypothesized that abundance and biomass of arthropods within feeding groups would increase from temperate latitudes towards the tropics. We also hypothesized that the ratio of carnivores to herbivores would be consistent along the latitudinal gradient. Three sites at each of four latitudes, spanning 9° and 1150 km (Batemans Bay, Sydney, Grafton, Gympie in Australia), were sampled every season for 2 years, using pyrethrum knockdown. Abundance and biomass (based on dry weight) of arthropods within eight feeding groups were measured. The relative size of the feeding groups, and the ratio of carnivores to herbivores were then compared among latitudes and seasons. We found no consistent north to south (tropical to temperate) change in feeding group structure in terms of abundance. A weak latitudinal trend was evident for predator biomass, consisting of a reduction from north to south, but no significant trends in biomass for other feeding groups were found. Relative abundance and relative biomass of both carnivores and herbivores, as well as the ratio of carnivores to herbivores were consistent among latitudes. Finally, we compared a subset of these data to arthropod communities found on congeneric host species at individual sites along the latitudinal gradient. Overall, 68{\%} of comparisons showed no significant differences in abundance or biomass within different feeding groups between host plants and among latitudes. We conclude that arthropod communities show consistencies among latitudes and between congeneric host species, in terms of feeding group and trophic structure. These results have implications for predicting the impacts of future climate change on arthropod communities.},

It shows the present cover distribution and declining trends of seagrasses on the Portuguese coast (1980-2010), identifies environmental and conservation issues, and discusses challenges for long-term survival.Seagrass populations of the Portuguese coast are also facing an unprecedented decline in distribution, matching the general trends described for most world seagrasses. The results of this investigation show a dramatic decrease of seagrass cover in Portugal in the last 20 years. This decrease followed different trends for the three species present on this coast. Zostera noltii, having disappeared from some systems by almost 75{\%}, is still the most abundant species, present in 10 of the 18 sites assessed. Zostera marina is presently the most endangered seagrass species in Portugal, as it disappeared from six of eight historical locations and faces extinction from the Portuguese territory if measures are not taken to assure the protection of the last regions left with populations. Cymodocea nodosa has a geographic distribution range limited to the southern/southwestern coasts, and its current conservation status is uncertain, although there is evidence for the recent occurrence of several population bottlenecks.Management questions are discussed and actions to improve habitat conservation are suggested.},

Tow duration, tow speed, filtration efficiency and filtration rate were monitored in real time during paired oblique (1-18m) tows. General tow characteristics and larval assemblages were compared for samples characterized by filtering efficiencies {\textgreater}85{\%}. Plankton tows characterized by relatively short durations (approximately 4.5min) and low filtered volumes (approximately 70m3) were largely overlapping in fish egg densities, larval densities, and length frequency distributions. Higher taxonomic richness (number of families) and diversity (exponential of Shannon Entropy) were observed in the 0.333mm mesh net. No significant differences in larval fish densities were observed between mesh sizes for seven families of fishes; only unidentified clupeiform fishes were more common in the 0.333mm mesh net. Mean lengths for total fish larvae, total non-clupeiform fish larvae, sciaenids and unidentified larvae were significantly larger in the 0.333mm collections. However no significant differences were noted in the length frequencies for these groups. We conclude that under controlled tow conditions, ichthyoplankton samples collected in our region with these two mesh sizes are largely comparable. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Poleward and upward shifts are the most frequent types of range shifts that have been reported in response to contemporary climate change. However, the number of reports documenting other types of range shifts - such as in east-west directions across longitudes or, even more unexpectedly, towards tropical latitudes and lower elevations - is increasing rapidly. Recent studies show that these range shifts may not be so unexpected once the local climate changes are accounted for. We here provide an updated synthesis of the fast-moving research on climate-related range shifts. By describing the current state of the art on geographical patterns of species range shifts under contemporary climate change for plants and animals across both terrestrial and marine ecosystems, we identified a number of research shortfalls. In addition to the recognised geographic shortfall in the tropics, we found taxonomic and methodological shortfalls with knowledge gaps regarding range shifts of prokaryotes, lowland range shifts of terrestrial plants, and bathymetric range shifts of marine plants. Based on this review, we provide a research agenda for filling these gaps. We outline a comprehensive framework for assessing multidimensional changes in species distributions, which should then be contrasted with expectations based on climate change indices, such as velocity measures accounting for complex local climate changes. Finally, we propose a unified classification of geographical patterns of species range shifts, arranged in a bi-dimensional space defined by species' persistence and movement rates. Placing the observed and expected shifts into this bi-dimensional space should lead to more informed assessments of extinction risks.},

abstract = {Predicting the ecological causes and consequences of global climate change requires a variety of approaches, including the use of experiments, models, and surveys. Among experiments, mesocosms have become increasingly popular because they provide an important bridge between smaller, more tightly controlled, microcosm experiments (which can suffer from limited realism) and the greater biological complexity of natural systems (in which mechanistic relationships often cannot be identified). A new evaluation of the contribution of the mesocosm approach, its potential for future research, as well as its limitations, is timely. As part of this review, we constructed a new database of over 250 post-1990 studies that have explored different components of climate change across a range of organisational levels, scales, and habitats. Issues related to realism, reproducibility and control are assessed in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial systems. Some general patterns emerged, particularly at the ecosystem level, such as consistent and predictable effects on whole-system respiration rates. There are, however, also many seemingly idiosyncratic, contingent responses, especially at the community level, both within and among habitat types. These similarities and differences in both the drivers and responses highlight the need for caution before making generalisations. Finally, we assess future directions and prospects for new methodological advances and the need for greater international coordination and interdisciplinarity. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2015, The Waterbird Society. All rights reserved.The availability of suitable breeding habitats is an important factor in explaining seabird demographic fluctuations. For ground nesting seabirds, such as Little Terns (Sternula albifrons), an essential characteristic in determining suitability of breeding habitats is vegetative cover. This study evaluated whether the long-term fluctuations (1979-2014) in Little Tern breeding numbers on sandy beach colonies of Ria Formosa, Algarve, Portugal, could be explained by changes in vegetation cover at each sandy beach colony, environmental variability (measured by the climatic North Atlantic Oscillation index), or a combination of both. The percentage of vegetation cover for each sandy beach was calculated from aerial photos of Ria Formosa barrier islands from 1976 to 2012, and related to breeding census data from the same period. The climatic variation measured by the North Atlantic Oscillation index did not show a significant relationship with the number of breeding pairs nesting on each sandy beach colony. A segmented regression model constructed to model the effect of vegetation cover on the number of breeding pairs on sandy beaches found an optimal vegetation cover of around 10{\%} and an overall breakpoint of 42{\%}vegetation cover; the model predicted that only ∼4{\%} of breeding pairs would endure with 90{\%} vegetation cover and none would endure with 92{\%} vegetation cover. Little Terns in Ria Formosa appear to adopt a fugitive strategy, moving their colonies to locations with better breeding conditions in response to the overgrowth of vegetation.},

abstract = {Although an ecosystem's response to biodiversity loss depends on the order in which species are lost, the extinction sequences generally used to explore such responses in food webs have been ecologically unrealistic. We investigate how several extinction orders affect the minimum number of secondary extinctions expected within pelagic food webs from 34 temperate freshwater lakes. An ecologically plausible extinction order is derived from the geographically nested pattern of species composition among the lakes and is corroborated by species' pH tolerances. Simulations suggest that lake communities are remarkably robust to this realistic extinction order and highly sensitive to the reverse sequence of species loss. This sensitivity is not well explained by the known sensitivity of networks to the loss of highly connected species but appears to be better explained by our observation that trophic specialists preferentially consume widely distributed species at low risk of extinction. Our results highlight an important aspect of community organization that may help to maintain biodiversity amidst changing environments. {\textcopyright} 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Here we present a new method for directly measuring, on a per capita basis, the nonlinear strength of trophic species interactions within such food webs. This is an observation-based method, requiring three pieces of information: (1) species abundances, (2) predator and prey-specific handling times, and (3) data from predator-specific feeding surveys in which the number of individuals observed feeding on each of the predator's prey species has been tallied. The method offers a straightforward way to assess the completeness of one's sampling effort in accurately estimating interaction strengths through the construction of predator-specific prey accumulation curves. The method should be applicable to a variety of systems in which empirical estimates of direct interaction strengths have thus far remained elusive. {\textcopyright} 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.},

Observers measured up to 3 distances: these were (i) a "dread," or initial panic, (ii) the distance at which the first individual flushed, and (iii) the distance at which the majority of the colony flushed. The total time that birds spent in the air after flushing was also recorded. Mixed colonies of Common Terns-Black Skimmers responded at the greatest distances ("dread"), with respective means of 142 and 130 m; mixed wading bird species were more reluctant to flush (30-50 m average). There were few statistically significant relationships between flushing distances and colony size. Similarly, there were few differences between responses during incubation compared to post-hatching periods. The disturbance distances measured in this study are much greater than the 50 m guideline suggested in a 1976 National Park Service report. I recommend distances of 100 m for Least and Royal Terns and wading birds and 200 m for Common Terns and skimmers for sign-posting of established colonies. Greater distances will be necessary as a buffer before birds become established at a site.},

For conical nets the model provides simple expressions for the filtration efficiency and drag as functions of twine diameter, mesh opening, porosity, taper angle and flow (towing) velocity.

In many regions, climate models forecast shifts in precipitation patterns that will exacerbate droughts in rivers and streams, yet ecological impacts on freshwater ecosystems remain poorly understood. We report the results of a stream mesocosm experiment designed to test the effect of drought on the resilience of replicate macroinvertebrate communities, via direct manipulation of flows. Drying disturbances applied at high (monthly) and low (quarterly) frequency over 21-months had contrasting effects on the structure and temporal dynamics of the communities. Macroinvertebrates were resilient to low-frequency disturbance, sustaining abundant and diverse communities, which developed over experimental time. By comparison, high-frequency disturbance exceeded the capacity for recovery, skewing community structure, and generated relatively impoverished, static assemblages dominated by fewer species. Species responses ranged from extirpation to irruption, with smaller short-lived taxa (≤. 1 generation per year), notably chironomids and worms, replacing larger taxa with longer life cycles (≥. 1 generation per year). This research provides one of the first experimental tests of resilience to drought in aquatic ecosystems. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Parasitism is the most common animal lifestyle, yet food webs rarely include parasites. The few earlier studies have indicated that including parasites leads to obvious increases in species richness, number of links, and food chain length. A less obvious result was that adding parasites slightly reduced connectance, a key metric considered to affect food web stability. However, reported reductions in connectance after the addition of parasites resulted from an inappropriate calculation. Two alternative corrective approaches applied to four published studies yield an opposite result: parasites increase connectance, sometimes dramatically. In addition, we find that parasites can greatly affect other food web statistics, such as nestedness (asymmetry of interactions), chain length, and linkage density. Furthermore, whereas most food webs find that top trophic levels are least vulnerable to natural enemies, the inclusion of parasites revealed that mid-trophic levels, not low trophic levels, suffered the highest vulnerability to natural enemies. These results show that food webs are very incomplete without parasites. Most notably, recognition of parasite links may have important consequences for ecosystem stability because they can increase connectance and nestedness. connectance | parasitism | trophic | predation | trematode},

abstract = {The number of prey killed by diverse predator communities is determined by complementarity and interference among predators, and by traits of particular predator species. However, it is less clear how predators' nonconsumptive effects (NCEs) scale with increasing predator biodiversity. We examined NCEs exerted on Culex mosquitoes by a diverse community of aquatic predators. In the field, mosquito larvae co-occurred with differing densities and species compositions of mesopredator insects; top predator dragonfly naiads were present in roughly half of surveyed water bodies. We reproduced these predator community features in artificial ponds, exposing mosquito larvae to predator cues and measuring resulting effects on mosquito traits throughout development. Nonconsumptive effects of various combinations of mesopredator species reduced the survival of mosquito larvae to pupation, and reduced the size and longevity of adult mosquitoes that later emerged from the water. Intriguingly, adding single dragonfly naiads to ponds restored survivorship of larval mosquitoes to levels seen in the absence of predators, and further decreased adult mosquito longevity compared with mosquitoes emerging from mesopredator treatments. Behavioral observations revealed that mosquito larvae regularly deployed “diving” escape behavior in the presence of the mesopredators, but not when a dragonfly naiad was also present. This suggests that dragonflies may have relaxed NCEs of the mesopredators by causing mosquitoes to abandon energetically costly diving. Our study demonstrates that adding one individual of a functionally unique species can substantially alter community-wide NCEs of predators on prey. For pathogen vectors like mosquitoes, this could in turn influence disease dynamics.},

abstract = {Dynamic Green Ocean Models (DGOMs) include different sets of Plankton Functional Types (PFTs) and equations, thus different interactions and food webs. Using four DGOMs (CCSM-BEC, PISCES, NEMURO and PlankTOM5) we explore how predator-prey interactions influence food web dynamics. Using each model's equations and biomass output, interaction strengths (direct and specific) were calculated and the role of zooplankton in modeled food webs examined. In CCSM-BEC the single size-class adaptive zooplankton preys on different phytoplankton groups according to prey availability and food preferences, resulting in a strong top-down control. In PISCES the micro- and meso-zooplankton groups compete for food resources, grazing phytoplankton depending on their availability in a mixture of bottom-up and top-down control. In NEMURO macrozooplankton controls the biomass of other zooplankton PFTs and defines the structure of the food web with a strong top-down control within the zooplankton. In PlankTOM5, competition and predation between micro- and meso-zooplankton along with strong preferences for nanophytoplankton and diatoms, respectively, leads to their mutual exclusion with a mixture of bottom-up and top-down control of the plankton community composition. In each model, the grazing pressure of the zooplankton PFTs and the way it is exerted on their preys may result in the food web dynamics and structure of the model to diverge from the one that was intended when designing the model. Our approach shows that the food web dynamics, in particular the strength of the predator-prey interactions, are driven by the choice of parameters and more specifically the food preferences. Consequently, our findings stress the importance of equation and parameter choice as they define interactions between PFTs and overall food web dynamics (competition, bottom-up or top-down effects). Also, the differences in the simulated food-webs between different models highlight the gap of knowledge for zooplankton rates and predator-prey interactions. In particular, concerted effort is needed to identify the key growth and loss parameters and interactions and quantify them with targeted laboratory experiments in order to bring our understanding of zooplankton at a similar level to phytoplankton. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Knowledge of the possible impacts of climate change on biodiversity in the tropics is especially scarce. We used maximum entropy modeling of species distributions to predict the ranges of endemic and threatened Atlantic Forest birds under a "business as usual" emissions scenario for 2050. Of the 51 species with reliable models, 44 were predicted to lose distribution area, with future ranges averaging 45{\%} of their original size. Range contraction would bring two species to IUCN's threshold for threat under the Extent of Occurrence criterion. We also predict that the size of the regions that currently have the maximum number of endemic and threatened birds would be greatly reduced. Several such regions are currently highly deforested, which might reinforce the future threat to biodiversity. {\textcopyright} 2011 ABECO.},

abstract = {Seahorses represent a hitherto unexplored genre of fisheries, those intended primarily for medicine rather than food. The majority of seahorses go to traditional Chinese medicine and its derivatives. China's economic growth since the mid-1980s is probably the principal agent in a surge in demand for seahorses. In response, and in part because other marine resources are declining, subsistence and small-scale fishers in Asia target seahorses and many obtain the majority of their annual income from these fishes. At least 32 nations around the world are involved in trading seahorses. Information obtained during interviews, in combination with the few published customs statistics available, suggest that annual consumption just within Asian nations may amount to 45 t of dried seahorses annually. Totals and rankings, however, should be interpreted with great caution because data are still tentative and because it was not possible to investigate nations expected to be large consumers (Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore...). Extracting seahorses at current rates appears to be having a serious effect on their populations. Demand far exceeds supply, according to almost all those interviewed. Available evidence indicates that consumption should be reduced if long-term persistence of their population is to be assured. Conservation and management of seahorses would benefit from a series of integrated measures. Recent small-scale conservation initiatives in the Philippines and Vietnam are experiencing initial success.},

abstract = {Predator–prey interactions in natural ecosystems generate complex food webs that have a simple universal body-size architecture where predators are systematically larger than their prey. Food-web theory shows that the highest predator–prey body-mass ratios found in natural food webs may be especially important because they create weak interactions with slow dynamics that stabilize communities against perturbations and maintain ecosystem functioning. Identifying these vital interactions in real communities typically requires arduous identification of interactions in complex food webs. Here, we overcome this obstacle by developing predator-trait models to predict average body-mass ratios based on a database comprising 290 food webs from freshwater, marine and terrestrial ecosystems across all continents. We analysed how species traits constrain body-size architecture by changing the slope of the predator–prey body-mass scaling. Across ecosystems, we found high body-mass ratios for predator groups with specific trait combinations including (1) small vertebrates and (2) large swimming or flying predators. Including the metabolic and movement types of predators increased the accuracy of predicting which species are engaged in high body-mass ratio interactions. We demonstrate that species traits explain striking patterns in the body-size architecture of natural food webs that underpin the stability and functioning of ecosystems, paving the way for community-level management of the most complex natural ecosystems.},

abstract = {Both local and initial conditions have been implicated in causing variation in the strengths of predator effects among natural communities. In this study, I performed a controlled mesocosm experiment using two common snails, Physella gyrina and Helisoma trivolvis, and their insect predator, Belostoma flumineum, to explicitly quantify and understand the causes of previously observed variation in food web interactions in natural ecosystems. The results from a controlled mesocosm experiment showed that: (1) at low productivity, snails were dominated by small-vulnerable species (P. gyrina), predator effects were strong and predator effects caused a trophic cascade extending to producers; (2) at high productivity, snails were dominated by large-invulnerable species (H. trivolvis), predator effects were weak and there was no trophic cascade to producers; (3) at intermediate productivity, alternative stable equilibria were implicated, such that depending on initial conditions, snails were dominated by either small-vulnerable or large-invulnerable species and predator effects were either strong or weak. Thus, this study represents one of the first to quantify how variation in food web structure can result from the local environment, initial conditions and their interaction.},

A keystone species is held to be a strongly interacting species whose top-down effect on species diversity and competition is large relative to its biomass dominance within a functional group. This operational definition links the community importance of keystone species to a specific ecosystem process, e.g., the regulation of species diversity, within functional groups at lower trophic levels that are structured by competition for a limited resource. The a priori prediction of keystone species has applied value for the conservation of natural areas. {\textcopyright} 2003 by the author(s).},
