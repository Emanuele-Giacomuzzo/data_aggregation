"Aggregation of the food web of Figure 5 according to different clustering algortihms. The size of the nodes is prortional to the number of nodes that have been aggregated into them. The self-loops are not included in the figure for clarity. (a) = jaccard, (b) = rege, (c) = density-based modules, (d) = prey-based modules, (e) = predator-based modules, (f) = groups found by the group model. As you can see in (d), aggregation might cause to produce a node that is not connected to the rest of the network."
